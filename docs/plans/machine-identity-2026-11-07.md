# Each machine keeps its own: a plan

*Slices 1 to 3 are built: the stop goes to whatever is on a port, a port that
changes hands forgets what was held in memory for its last board, and a bed
reading is the board's that took it. The rest is not built. Each slice is one
pull request, in the order below.*

## What this plans

Apothecary drives an Ender 3 (Marlin), a CNC router (GRBL) and ESP32 devkits
over serial. It finds each board by its port name, and a port name moves: the
Ender has come back as `/dev/ttyUSB0` after a night as `/dev/ttyUSB1`, and the
router's CH340 came up on `/dev/ttyUSB0`, a name the Ender once had. Much of
what the app keeps about a machine is keyed by that name, and much of what one
kind of machine does is reachable from another. So a board can wear another
board's record, and a file made for one kind of machine can be sent to the
other.

It has happened. The router wore the Ender's bed mesh, drawn as a relief over its
table, because bed readings are kept and fetched by port name alone. That is one
case of a family; this plan closes the family, not the case:

- **One answer to "which board is on this port, and what kind of machine is it".**
  Every record and every cache asks it, and nothing answers it again for itself.
- **A record belongs to the board that made it**, and a cache keyed by a port
  forgets its board when the port changes hands.
- **One kind of machine's work is refused on another at the server**, whatever
  the page believes, and the stop goes to whatever is on the port, in its own
  dialect.

## What was found

A read of the firmware seam, the jobs, the slicer, the toolpath, the preview,
the page's machine code and the family members, on main at 8601a5e. Each finding
names where it is; the ones marked *now* give a wrong outcome on the machines as
they are, the others need a sequence that has not happened yet.

### A board wearing another board's state

| What | Keyed by | Where | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bed readings | the port name only; a reading records no board | `devices.leveling_records` (`rec.port == port`), the page's `refreshReading`, the Machine's `loadLevel` | *now*: the router wears the Ender's mesh; a second printer would show the first one's |
| A pin whose identity is a port name | the port name: `same_device` answers yes for any board there | `bindings.same_device`, then `_pinned_at`, `_sync_printer_status`, the family's `Machine` | *now* once the router is pinned from the port list (a CH340 with no serial number pins as its port): the Ender on that name takes the router's node, its polls write onto both, and a step for the router goes to the Ender |
| The last poll, the stream job, the bed-reading job, the comms log, the control latch, the held link | the port name, in server memory | `devices._LAST_STATUS`, `_PRINTS`, `_LEVELING`, `gcode.PrinterLinks`, `ControlLatch` | the next board on the port is shown the last one's state and log, refused as "printing", or found armed |
| A flash record made before the board was probed | the port name | `devices.make_flash_record`, `last_flash` | a printer later on that port "should run" the sketch, and the sketch's node binds to it |
| The page's machine marks, where a machine stands, a drawn toolpath, the board model | the port name, never cleared when the board changes | `ensureMarks`, `whereByPort`, `toolpathByPort`, `boards.js` | a page left open across a replug moves one machine's marks with another's polls |
| A device record | the port, checked against what the port list sees there | `FirmwareState.cached_device` | checked; trusted unchecked when the port list cannot be read |

### One kind of machine's work reachable from another

| What | Where kind is checked | Where it is not | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| A kept file streamed to the other kind | nowhere: a kept file records no kind; a slice's and a toolpath's records do, and nothing reads them before a stream | `devices.start_print`, the family's `run` | *now*: `docs/validation/dry-run-square.gcode` streams on the router: its `G28` moves it to a stored position, and its `G4 P500` dwells wait 500 s each, GRBL's `P` being seconds |
| A G-code check per dialect | one list for both | `gcode.check_gcode` | a file with Marlin's `M117` or `M84` is accepted for a cut; GRBL answers a code it does not take with `error:20`, and the link fails the cut at that line (`gcode.py` raises on an `error:` answer) |
| The stop | the server takes only the port's own dialect's stop | `devices.printer_control`, `normalise_control` | a Machine that takes a router for a printer sends `M112`; the server refuses it and nothing stops |
| A bed reading started on a router | the page hides the card; the server checks only for a link | `devices.start_leveling` | `G28` then `G29` sent raw to a router: it moves, then refuses |
| The page's kind for a board not yet known | four defaults that disagree | `machine.js` `kindOf` (printer), `machine_words.kindOf` (devkit), the page's `machineKindAt` (printer), `boards.watch` (printer) | a router not yet identified is drawn, polled and offered controls as a printer |
| Corner moves on a router | the ring refuses a bed reading, not a corner | `machine.js` `carryOut` | four `G1` moves a router accepts |

Kind is decided once, at identification (`devices._identify`, `PrinterInfo.machine`),
and read through `machine_kind`; that is sound, and the seam keeps it.

## The seam

`apothecary/firmware/occupants.py`, one module, one question: **who is on this
port now.** Its answer, an `Occupant`, is the port, the board's own key, its
identity as pins store it, its kind (`printer`, `router`, `devkit`, or none while
unknown), its dialect and its firmware's name, built from the device record
`cached_device` has already checked against the port list.

- **The board's key** is its MAC or its USB bridge's serial number when it has
  one. A bridge with none, as the router's CH340, is keyed by its maker and
  product (`vid:pid`, in one case): that follows the board across port numbers,
  and two such bridges of one make on the machine at once are told apart by
  nothing, so while both are present, records under that key are attributed to
  neither: a new reading is refused saying why, and the list is empty.
- **A port that changes hands**: the port list remembers what it last found on
  each port, kept while the port is empty; when another board is found there,
  one function, `devices.forget_port`, lets go of every cache the firmware
  package keys by a port: the last poll, a finished job, the held link, the
  latch and the comms log. Those caches are read only after the port list, so
  nothing reads the last board's state before it is forgotten.
- **Kind at the server**: a job's file, a bed reading, a control line and a
  family step each ask the occupant's kind, and refuse on a mismatch, with what
  to do instead. An occupant of unknown kind gets nothing that moves it but the
  stop.

## The slices

Each is a pull request; a slice that needs another's work stacks on it.

1. **The stop always reaches the board** (`build/stop-always-sent`; built). A
   stop asked in either dialect's word goes as the stop of what is on the port:
   `RESET` to a router for a printer's `M112`, and `M112` to a printer for a
   router's `RESET`. `docs/cnc.md` and `docs/firmware.md` say so.
2. **A port that changes hands forgets its board** (`build/port-changes-hands`;
   built). The port list remembers what it last found on each port; another
   board found there makes `devices.forget_port` let go of the last poll, a
   finished job, the link, the latch and the comms log. The link registry and
   the latch read the port list before they answer, so no reader gets around it.
   Held by tests that run a print on the simulated printer, put the router on
   its port, and ask each of the page's questions first.
3. **Who is on a port, and a bed reading belongs to the board that took it**
   (`build/readings-by-board`; built). `apothecary/firmware/occupants.py`
   answers the port's board, its key and its kind; its first reader is the bed
   reading. A reading records its board's key and kind; readings are listed for
   the occupant's key; a reading kept before this, with no key, is the
   occupant's only when it is a printer on the port the reading was taken on
   whose firmware is the one the reading names. A bed reading is refused on
   anything but a printer, and while a key is shared; the page lays a reading
   over a printer's bed alone. Held by tests that take a reading on the
   simulated printer and put the router on its port, and by a browser test that
   starts with a printer's reading kept under the router's port name.
4. **A kept file says which kind of machine it is for.** A file records
   `printer` or `router`: Choose File records the Machine's kind, a slice
   records `printer`, a toolpath `router`. A stream refuses a file of the other
   kind, and one that records none, saying how to keep it for this machine. The
   check is per dialect: a router's file is refused for a code GRBL does not
   take, and a dwell over a minute is named with its unit.
5. **A pin, a flash record and a job by port name check the bridge** (on 3). A
   board with no serial number is pinned with its bridge's `vid:pid` as well,
   and matches a board on that port only when the bridge is the same; a flash
   record and a job of such a board record the occupant's key.
6. **The page keeps a machine's marks by board** (on 3). Marks, where a machine
   stands and a drawn toolpath are rebuilt when the board on a node's port
   changes; one function says a board's kind, and a board not yet identified is
   of no kind, never a printer.
7. **A machine planned before it connects** (on 6). A machine's Machine opens
   without its board: what it will make, its toolpath or slice written and
   previewed, kept as that machine's plan and chosen when its board connects.

`docs/bench-checklist.md` is kept with each: a slice that changes what a person
sees at the bench changes its box.

## Not built

- Two serial-less bridges of one make at once (above): told apart by nothing
  the bridge says; a USB socket's location would tell them apart until one is
  moved.
- A generic serial number, as some CP2102 bridges carry (`0001`), is trusted as
  unique.
- Evidence, the jobs' history and kept print records from before a slice keep
  what they recorded; they are read by the new key where they have one.
