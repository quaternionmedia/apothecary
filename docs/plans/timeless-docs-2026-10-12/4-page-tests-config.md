# Inventory: the page and the tests

Area: the comments in `templates/fractal_viewer.html.j2` and `apothecary/static/**/*.js` (vendor excluded);
the docstrings and comments in `tests/**/*.py` and `tests/e2e/*.py`; the comments in
`.github/workflows/*.yml`, `pyproject.toml` and `REUSE.toml`. Read at `wt-timeless`
(`build/timeless-docs`, c67725a). Every comment and docstring was extracted with its line
number and read; line numbers below are the source file's.

## 1. Verdict

**Moderate overall, concentrated, and almost all of it history.** About 308 narrating passages in
99 of the 164 files read (7 of 7 configuration files, 11 of 17 page scripts, the template, 53 of 97
unit-test files, 27 of 42 browser-test files); ornament is rare (a few capitals, one bold sentence)
and stale statements are few but real. The history takes three shapes. (1) **A test docstring that
tells its bug instead of its property** -- "used to ...", "Seen on the bench", "the review found",
"An earlier version ..." -- the largest group, heaviest in test_firmware_gcode, test_gathering,
test_working_together, the photo tests and test_onboarding; nearly every one already states the
property in its next sentence, so most fixes are a deleted sentence plus a retrospective line.
(2) **The page's consolidation story**: the monitor page, the firmware page, the cells Watch and
Monitor "had", the SCAD editor "where the read-only source stood", Load, Zoom Out and Regenerate STL
"gone". It is told in the template, machine.js, test_menu, test_one_machine, test_ring and
test_printer_ui -- the Watch/Monitor cell story at least four times. (3) **Provenance asides**:
dated plan citations and "(the owner's answer of 2026-10-xx)" in module headers, docstrings and the
ring's tests (roughly fifty plan mentions and thirty owner mentions by grep, the census ledger
included); each is a one-clause delete, and each will point at a retired plan once the plans move to
the History list. The page's own code (JS and template) is mostly clean present-tense prose; its
template keeps its history in the older navigation comments (axis swap, far plane, grid helpers,
the Contents tree). **Structural issues:** (a) `tests/test_census.py:14-460` is a ~450-line ledger in
a comment above one constant, and it is the only place the census's classification rules are
written down -- a reference page must exist before it is cut; (b) the three seed workflows are
byte-identical copies of qm's `project-seed/ci/`, so they are fixed upstream, and their shared
concurrency comment cites qm's own run counts as "this repository's", which is false here; (c) the
gate does not read `.j2` and matches "used to" with eight verbs only, so under `tests/` it reports 4
of these 236 test passages and none of the template's 35; (d) contradictions: doc_capture.py's
module docstring says it never writes on a normal run while its own `Walkthrough` class and the
conftest say every run writes its page; test_menu.py says the garage has thirteen pieces,
test_ring.py sixteen, and the code builds fourteen; test_menu.py:1959 says a camera is pinned at a
host while 1745 in the same file says it is a part; test_part_iteration.py says the server "does not
say yet" fields ParamField carries; the template's "all three printers" meets a garage of one.
**Walkthrough pages** are written by six browser tests (pages 11-16; listed under Browser tests),
whose page text is left to the walkthrough reviewer.

## 2. Files

### Configuration and CI

#### .github/workflows/adr-lint.yml -- moderate, 4 narrating passages
A seed file: byte-identical to qm's `project-seed/ci/adr-lint.yml` (diffed against the main
checkout's `governance/qm`). Every fix here is made in the qm seed and copied back, or the
"copy verbatim" contract breaks.

| line(s) | quote (≤ 15 words) | problem | home | rewrite or note (≤ 25 words) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 22-26 | "codecartographer mounts it at docs/qm on its default branch to this day" | history / stale (another project's status); the sentence is also garbled ("so this is a / is named") | inline (in the qm seed) | "QM_SUBMODULE -- where this project mounts the governance submodule (governance/qm by default); named once here rather than per step." |
| 36-40 | "55 of this repository's 129 runs on 2026-08-11 came from five iterative pushes" | history + date + count; "this repository" is qm, so false in apothecary | inline (in the qm seed) | "A newer push to a pull request cancels the run it replaces." pytest.yml:11-12 already says it in two lines. |
| 3, 42 | "SEED FILE: copy verbatim"; "the run IS the record" | ornament (capitals for emphasis) | inline | "Seed file: copy verbatim ..."; "the run is the record of what that commit reported". |

#### .github/workflows/reuse-lint.yml -- moderate, 4 narrating passages
Seed file, identical to qm's `project-seed/ci/reuse-lint.yml`; same rule for fixes.

| 3, 34 | "SEED FILE"; "the run IS the record" | ornament | inline | Ordinary case. |

#### .github/workflows/submodule-check.yml -- moderate, 5 narrating passages
Seed file, identical to qm's `project-seed/ci/submodule-check.yml`. The `echo "::error::... Do NOT use 'git ls-remote'..."` at the end is a runtime message, not a comment; noted only (same capitals).

| line(s) | quote (≤ 15 words) | problem | home | rewrite or note (≤ 25 words) |

The story fits the 2026-07-21 verify-before-fixing perspective or a seed retrospective. |
| 18 | "this check is SELF-CONTAINED rather than run from the governance submodule" | ornament | inline | "self-contained". |
| 31-35 | "55 of this repository's 129 runs on 2026-08-11" | history + date + count; duplicate (third copy) | inline (in the qm seed) | As adr-lint.yml. |

#### REUSE.toml -- moderate, 1 (one block)
| line(s) | quote (≤ 15 words) | problem | home | rewrite or note (≤ 25 words) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6-9 | "which is what this repository has claimed publicly since its README was written" | history (what was missing before); duplicate of the adoption-scope record §2 (`governance/qm/adr/DRAFT-constitution-adoption-scope.md`), which tells the LICENSE gap | delete (keep one line) | "MIT throughout, as README and LICENSE state; the reasoning is the adoption-scope record's." Lines 11-16 (datum's dependency, why not per-file headers) stay. |

### templates/fractal_viewer.html.j2 -- moderate, 35 narrating passages in about 600 comments
The gate does not read `.j2` (its file types are .py, hash- and slash-commented files and .md), so
the largest prose file in this area is outside `--all`: line 988's "used to be" would be flagged if it <!-- timeless: allow quoting a phrase the check flags, in the sweep's own inventory -->
were read. Most of the history lies in the older navigation code (axis swap, far plane, helpers, the
Contents tree) and is told as "the old ...", "used to", "now", and three duplicates of stories the
JS modules also tell.

The gate sees four of the 236 test passages listed here. It misses the many "used to" with other
verbs (`used to write / redirect / keep / force-close / stop / render / end / feed / leave / skip /
print / replace / remove / hand back / die / share` -- well over a dozen in this area), every "Seen on the
bench", "the review found", "(the owner's answer of ...)", and every plan citation. It does not read
`.j2` at all, so `templates/fractal_viewer.html.j2` (35 passages, among them a literal "This used to
be a fixed 20000") is outside `--all`. A gate that widened `used to` to any verb, and read `.j2` as
slash- and HTML-commented, would catch most of the "used to" rows without new false positives in
this area.

## 3. Retrospectives this area needs

Each is one dated file in the qm corpus's `perspectives/`.

**apothecary: the viewer page**
- Six render functions and four pollers drew one board and disagreed; one board model and one writer replaced them (boards.js:3, board_text.js:4).
- The far plane, fixed at 20000, clipped the garage when the dolly clamp reached ~54000 (template 985, 2347).
- A group named from a picture's vocabulary got no colour and no filter chip, so it was invisible (template 842).
- Moving any item re-scaled every real mesh on screen into a screen-filling artefact (template 5871).
- /viewer redirected to whichever site sorted first, so registering a site moved the front door (test_api.py:128).
- The viewer was read and believed and did not work offline; the gathering map is driven instead (test_gathering_map_in_a_browser.py:3, 79).
- The board and place badges printed over each other at the garage's top level (test_less_on_screen.py:131).
- The monitor page and the firmware page became a board's Machine and the Bench; Regenerate STL, Load and Zoom Out went (machine.js:3, template 1439, test_printer_ui.py, test_one_machine.py, test_edit_a_made_piece.py:197).

**apothecary: the ring and its addresses**
- Watch and Monitor became Open; Flash took Monitor's cell, so Control returned to 7 and ⌗2728 survived (test_menu.py:421, 612; test_one_machine.py:313; test_ring.py:143).
- The census ledger: every phase's control counts, ring-backed share and address moves (test_census.py:14-460, 810).
- The owner's answers that seated View, Variants, Print and the Device section (test_menu.py, test_part_iteration_answers.py:251, 505).

**apothecary: the printer link**
- With HUPCL set the kernel dropped DTR on close and the Ender rebooted on the next open (test_firmware_gcode.py:244).
- The port renumbered overnight and a pin made by port name pointed at nothing (test_firmware_gcode.py:1584).
- `where` said nothing was pinned before the garage had loaded (test_firmware_gcode.py:1648).
- One lost poll reply closed the link under a print; the safe-off was never sent and the heaters stayed on (test_firmware_gcode.py:1709).
- The safe-off stopped at its first unanswered line (test_firmware_gcode.py:1739).
- Interleaved writes of the state file kept 12 of 200 pins (test_firmware_devices.py:399).

**apothecary: photos and the gathering**
- An independent review broke the picture path; every hard-case test failed before it passed (test_photo_hard_cases.py:1).
- A mutation review: 24 of 27 injected faults were caught by nothing (test_gathering.py:438).
- One folder in nine orders gave five answers (test_gathering.py:462, 478); one matching shape made two photographs one thing (519).
- Self-skipping tests made the question ranking deletable with the suite green; --answers was ignored and --ask overwrote notes (test_working_together.py:60, 732).
- A picture's arrangement named 'garage' replaced the built-in site (test_photo_in_the_viewer.py:287; test_pictures_api.py:377).

**apothecary: the datum parts**
- Retiring `parts/datum` settled wall thickness and fit clearance; `board_y` stays contested (test_contested_values.py:3; test_readiness.py:74).
- The stub check read build()'s tuple as an Assembly and reported "no stubs remain" (test_readiness.py:94).
- calibration_cube was reported as fitted to datum's board (test_readiness.py:108; test_spaces.py:74).
- Scene objects rendered at the origin while the Python model looked right (test_datum_assembly.py:147).

**apothecary: the test suite and the walkthrough**
- Options defined in tests/e2e/conftest.py made `pytest tests walkthrough` die with "unrecognized arguments" (tests/conftest.py:10).
- Two demonstrations, one of them stale behind a remembered command, became one walkthrough written by its run (test_docs_photo_walkthrough.py:7).
- A re-encoded screenshot left the tracked pictures modified on every run (doc_capture.py:239).

**qm: the seed workflows** (the qm corpus's own, since the three files are verbatim seed copies)
- qmetronome's v0.0.28 build and apothecary on 2026-07-21 both hit "not our ref"; the check was carried as a seed (submodule-check.yml:12-16).
- 55 of 129 runs on 2026-08-11 came from iterative pushes, which set the concurrency rule (adr-lint.yml:36, reuse-lint.yml:28, submodule-check.yml:31).

## 4. Reference pages this area needs

- **docs/viewer.md** (exists) already states render on demand (line 88), the ring (line 94) and "The parameters and the SCAD are one draft" (line 195). Every plan citation for those decisions in anchors.js, assignments.js, part_controls.js, scad_editor.js, the template (891, 4119) and the tests (test_text_is_the_truth.py, test_render_on_demand.py, test_text_tied.py) can point here instead. Check that the part editor section also states the staging rules (check on rest, Apply renders, ghost, recent applies) before the plans retire.
- **docs/census.md** (to be made, or a section of CONTRIBUTING.md): what `apothecary census` counts -- controls of its own, ring-backed, places the page listens, `census.MARKS`, `census.TAKEN_BACK` as the lasting exception -- and how the ceiling and the share's floor move. Today those rules exist only inside the ledger at test_census.py:14-460.
- **docs/slicer.md** (exists): Slice as a step of the page, the target of machine.js:34 and test_menu.py:1467.
- **docs/firmware.md** (exists): the toolchain modules, the target of test_firmware_modules.py:3.
- **docs/parts-authoring.md** (exists): "a part's default is its SCAD as saved", the target of test_defaults_are_the_scad.py:1.
- **docs/validation/** (dated, exempt): a record of each strace that fixed an installer's host list (test_stays_local.py:314, 892), so the test can cite it instead of carrying the date.

## 5. Suggested order

1. **The seed workflows, upstream first** (adr-lint, reuse-lint, submodule-check): fix in qm's `project-seed/ci/`, re-copy. Three duplicate concurrency comments, two capitals, one stale aside, one story. Smallest, and every QM project gains.
2. **pyproject.toml, REUSE.toml, license-check.yml, pytest.yml**: four one-line edits, one of them a stale claim.
3. **The four gate findings** (test_menu.py:187, test_docs_photo_walkthrough.py:7, test_onboarding.py:313, test_picture_in_the_world.py:190): the measure moves from 4 to 0 under tests/.
4. **The stale rows** (doc_capture.py:1-9, test_menu.py:1959, test_part_iteration.py:9, test_slicer_api.py:368, test_docs_site.py:238, test_picture_in_the_world.py:10, machine.js:27, template 1103, license-check.yml:8, test_menu.py:885 vs test_ring.py:450): each says something false today.
5. **JS module headers** (11 files, 20 passages): most-read by anyone opening the page's code; mostly plan citations and one-clause history.
6. **The template**: the old navigation comments (axis, far plane, helpers, Contents tree) and the four retellings of the monitor/firmware pages; 35 passages in one file.
7. **Unit tests, light files first**, then the heavy ones in one PR each with their retrospective drafted alongside: test_firmware_gcode.py (the printer link), test_gathering.py + test_working_together.py + test_photo_*.py (photos), test_contested_values.py + test_readiness.py + test_spaces.py (datum), test_menu.py (the ring).
8. **test_census.py's ledger last**: write docs/census.md and the ring retrospective first, move the ring-address moves to CHANGELOG if they are wanted there, then cut lines 17-460 to the two-line rule.
9. **Browser tests**, with test_printer_ui.py, test_one_machine.py and test_onboarding.py after the viewer-page retrospective exists.
