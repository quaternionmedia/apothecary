# Inventory: the package's docstrings, comments and `--help` texts

Area 3 of the timeless-docs sweep: `apothecary/**/*.py` and the `--help` of every command, read
on the worktree `wt-timeless` (branch `build/timeless-docs`). Read-only. The modules' comments,
docstrings and `help=`/`description=` strings were extracted with their source line numbers
(`code-prose/`, by `extract_prose.py`) and read in full; the source was opened wherever a claim
needed checking. Line numbers are the source file's.

## 1. Verdict

The package is uneven. The `--help` texts and most docstrings are already written the way the
record wants: present tense, saying what a thing does, what it needs and what it refuses. Half
the modules (82 of 164) have nothing to sweep. The narration is concentrated. Five modules
hold a third of it: `menu.py`, `api.py`, `census.py`, `projects/parts/saved.py` and
`gathering/resolve.py`.

**What dominates is internal history in neutral words.** The stock phrases the gate can match
are rare (4 real hits). What the gate cannot see makes up nearly all of the 266 passages:

- owner decisions with dates and plan citations: "(the owner's answer of 2026-10-12)",
  "(loop 1, docs/plans/…)", "Decided with the owner on…". Nearly 40 places.
- the names a thing had before: "the firmware page", "the monitor page", "in the cell Watch
  had", "the old, depth-capped viewers", "as it always was", "before the text was the truth".
- past failures given as reasons, mostly in `gathering/`: "an earlier version…", "a reviewer
  showed…", "the meter caught…", and tables of past measurements.

**Stale statements are the second problem: 23 of them.** Examples: `docs generate` says it
writes one workflow, and two are marked `docs`. A field description in `/openapi.json`
(`params_in`) names a value the code no longer accepts. `api.py` calls composite-node
rendering "future work", and it is served. `example_hierarchy.py` gives a printer height of
576, and it is 570. `datum_core.py` says "three numbers" are contested, and one is.
`registry.py` calls `fifel/` and `footpedal/` canonical root folders, and neither exists.
`slicer/__init__.py` says "the page's step comes later", and the page slices.

**Structural issues:**

- **Docstrings that duplicate walkthrough pages.** `cli/preflight.py` copies
  walkthrough/09, `cli/status.py` copies walkthrough/07, and `release.py` with
  `cli/release.py` copy walkthrough/10. Each copy tells the same incident. The viewer's
  vendored three.js story is in `api.py`, `cli/system.py` and walkthrough/04.
- **Live code pointing at dated plans.** `kernel-reference --help`, `kernel_compare.py`, the
  slicer package, `part_edits.py`, `texts.py`, `assignments.py`, `menu.py` and `census.py` all
  cite `docs/plans/…`. When those plans retire to History, the code points at history.
- **No reference page for pictures.** The pictures/gathering/cameras area has no present-tense
  page in `docs/`. Its module docstrings (`vision/views.py`, `cameras.py`, `projection.py`,
  `gathering/*`) are the only reference, so explanations have nowhere to move to.
- **The datum story is told three times**, in `datum_core.py`, `datum_cap.py` and
  `datum_core_site.py`. `datum_cap.py:93-100` contradicts its own `contested={}`.
- **22 modules carry `PROTOTYPE — not ratified.`** The label is in capitals and does not name
  the record whose ratification it waits on.

## 2. Modules, worst first

Passages are counted as the sections below list them. A row that groups repeats counts each
place once. The 22 prototype labels are counted apart, in their own group row (pictures group).

Total: 244 narrating passages in 72 modules, plus 22 labels (10 modules carry only the
label). 82 of 164 modules are clean. Among the `--help` texts, 5 passages need a change, all
listed under the CLI.

## 3. The gate's findings under `apothecary/`

`check_timeless.py --all` reports 11 findings in the whole repository. Six are under
`apothecary/`; the other five are in `tests/` and `walkthrough/` (areas 2 and 4).

| finding | real? | row |
|---|---|---|
| `api.py:1517` "used to be" | real | api.py 1517-1520: inline + retrospective |
| `census.py:114` "was found in" | **false positive**: "The page was read and nothing was found in it" describes the refusal, in the present | -- |
| `datum_core_site.py:34` "used to be" | real | datum_core_site.py 34-36: inline + retrospective |
| `gathering/models.py:6` "was found in" | **false positive**: "enough was found in it" describes a picture, in the present | -- |
| `gathering/resolve.py:409` "used to be" | real | resolve.py 409-415: inline + retrospective |
| `hierarchy.py:220` "used to be" | real | hierarchy.py 220-221: inline |

For the record's tool: `was (found|caught|discovered) in` matches present-tense descriptions
of a search result. Both false positives use the shape "nothing/enough was found in it".
The pattern could require a narrating subject, or the two lines could carry
`timeless: allow` with a reason.

## 4. Stale statements (§1), each checked

| where | says | is | checked |

Checked and true: `cli/system.py:89-91` (the static "Layout valid" chip,
`templates/fractal_viewer.html.j2:702`); `cli/preflight.py:3-4` (`main` unprotected, 0
rulesets: `gh api`); the "for one release" of the retired commands (no release since 0.1.0);
the qm hierarchy record is still a DRAFT (so "(prototype, unratified)" is true); "Two finders
ship" (`finder.py:69-70`); "two scripted serial ports" (`firmware/scripted.py:60-66`).

## 5. Retrospectives this area needs (qm `perspectives/`, one dated file each)

**apothecary: gathering pictures**
- One-to-one matching let a coincidence lock the real match out (resolve.py:231-236, arrangement.py:145-146).
- The "every shape accounted for" exception made the rule unreachable, and a reviewer walked through it (resolve.py:409-415).
- Nine orders of one folder gave five results; the sort fixed it (resolve.py:577-582).
- The contradiction check broke groups a person had built (resolve.py:632-634).
- Answers about unreadable pictures were dropped silently (resolve.py:833-835; judgement.py:281-282).
- The meter caught the missing arrangement check: a square, a disc and a triangle joined unrelated photographs (arrangement.py:3-6).
- The fit tolerance went from 10% to 4% by measurement (arrangement.py:40-45); the 1.8 ratio table (resolve.py:143-155).
- The fit depended on hand-in order (arrangement.py:124-126).
- Twelve unrelated photographs were chained through weak seams, which scoring per occasion could not see (bench.py:310-314).
- Questions ranked by composite size; 22 s inside the loop; a dead guard deleted by a reviewer; the sheet piling up and overwriting notes; its own examples fed back (questions.py:86-88, 123-125, 132-133, 172-177, 212-214).
- The UTF-8 BOM that turned the first name into nobody (judgement.py:249-252).
- Pieces dropped when not numbered; middles laid wide parts on top of each other; one name replacing another (combine.py:60-62, 172-175, 222-226).
- A reset that did nothing while appearing to work (vision/shelf.py:84-87); a panel built a quarter turn out (plain.py:250-252).

**apothecary: datum_core and its numbers**
- parts/datum retired: its 2.4/0.2 values cited a record that does not contain them (datum_core.py:177-185, datum_cap.py:93-100).
- The `show` enum split into datum_cap (datum_core.py:143-145, datum_cap.py:7-10); the seam moved from parts/datum (datum_core.py:96-99, 124-125).
- Twelve defaults restated in the assembly and kept in step by a test, then read instead (datum_core_site.py:34-36).
- The readiness check read (Scene, Assembly) as one object and reported "no stubs remain" (readiness.py:466-468); calibration_cube was told about a board (477-479).
- A bare Cube at the origin while the Python model looked right (datum_bench.py:128-131); a contested value caught lying dormant (spaces.py:110-112).

**apothecary: one page, one viewer**
- The parts browser and the Site browser absorbed into the fractal viewer (api.py:2469-2471, 2512-2517, 2548-2558).
- The firmware page and printer monitor became the Bench and a board's Machine, with their links kept (api.py:2476-2495, census.py:65-67, 86-89, 249, 332-359, menu.py:654, 1308-1312, firmware/api.py:5-7, gcode.py).
- Ring cells kept their addresses through each change (menu.py:549, 661, 684, 1079, 1245, 1308-1312).
- `scad` attached only after a drag (api.py:1517-1520); the CDN copy of three.js that left the page empty (api.py:194-197).
- The JSCAD viewer's flags (cli/server.py:97-98); the depth-capped viewers (api.py:1435-1447).

**apothecary: the printer link** (shared with area 1's printer pages)
- Closing the link mid-print killed the print and left the heaters on (devices.py:639-641).
- ttyUSB0 became ttyUSB1 overnight; pins moved to the bridge serial (models.py:326-328).
- Interleaved read-modify-writes dropped pins (devices.py:113-115); a CP2102 under a realtime kernel repeated bytes (devices.py:1502-1503).
- Real silences cost the unit suite a minute (gcode.py:610-612).

**apothecary: CI and preflight**
- A green local suite hid a CI failure more than once (cli/preflight.py:50-53).
- In the sibling project, one workflow's `uv sync --locked` stripped the next workflow's tools (cli/preflight.py:119-123).
- Five workflows failed alike on a missing shell (cli/preflight.py:71-73).
- The CLI died on a check mark under cp1252 (cli/status.py:23-24).

**apothecary: the walkthrough and generated docs** (shared with area 2)
- The walkthrough was once produced by `apothecary docs`, and the remembered page went stale (cli/docs.py:3-9).

**apothecary: part editing in the browser** (shared with the part-iteration plan)
- Variants that kept values in `.variant.json`, then "the text is the truth" (saved.py:33-37 and its 10 repeats, part_edits.py, texts.py:3).
- Controls built by the page were not counted by the census (census.py:158-159).

**apothecary: firmware toolchain modules**
- The seam became the Arduino module "otherwise unchanged", with fields "as they always were" (the 8-place pattern).
- The scripted bench moved out of tests/ (scripted.py:10-11); espup's own install was replaced (rust_installer.py:664-666).

## 6. Reference pages to create or extend

- **docs/pictures.md (new).** Views and places, the one mapping, cameras and their lens, made
  pieces, the gathering's rules and why each threshold is shaped as it is, the finders and
  their limits. Module docstrings in `vision/` and `gathering/` then point here. Material:
  `vision/views.py:1-48`, `vision/projection.py:1-35`, `vision/cameras.py:1-34`,
  `gathering/resolve.py`, `arrangement.py`, `judgement.py`, `questions.py` (the present-tense
  rewrites).
- **A dated validation record in docs/validation/ (new): the gathering's and the finder's
  measured thresholds.** The tables in `resolve.py:143-155`, `arrangement.py:40-45`,
  `plain.py:53-56`, `judgement.py:3-5` and `models.py:286-290` move there. Each constant's
  comment then says what it is and names the record.
- **docs/viewer.md (extend): the ring's address rule.** A cell, once given, keeps its number,
  and new options are appended. This replaces the six "in the seat X had" comments in
  `menu.py` (549, 661, 684, 1079, 1245, 1308-1312).
- **docs/kernels.md (new), or docs/README.md "The Rust workspace" (extend).** The kernel
  comparison: corpus, reference, measures, tolerances. `kernel-reference --help` and
  `kernel_compare.py:3-4, 700-703` point here instead of at the dated spike.
- **docs/openscad.md (new), or docs/parts-authoring.md (extend).** Which OpenSCAD renders
  (`APOTHECARY_OPENSCAD`, the installed snapshot, PATH), the queue of runs, and 2021.01 against
  a snapshot. Material: `stl_renderer.py:138-151` (without the timing story),
  `openscad_installer.py`, `cli/openscad.py`.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md (extend), "moving a pinned tool".** The pin-bump procedure
  (`rust_installer.py:40-47`, `orcaslicer_installer.py:48-52`) stated once. The module comments
  keep the rule.
- **No new page** for the duplicates of walkthrough/04, 07, 09 and 10: the docstrings shrink
  to a pointer.

## 7. Suggested order for sweeping this area

1. **The `--help` texts and the `/openapi.json` descriptions**, which are read the most and
   are the smallest change: `preflight` (50-53), `parts verify` (275-278), `elephant-walk`'s
   "Note:", `openscad install`'s "yet", `kernel-reference`'s plan link, and `part_edits.py`'s
   `params_in` (stale) and its "from a caller before the text was the truth" (171-172,
   609-610). One commit.
2. **The 23 stale statements** (section 4). Each is a fact made true again: small, safe and
   checkable. One commit per package (cli, firmware, api, projects, examples, slicer). Flag the
   dead `fifel/`/`footpedal/` branches for the cleanup triage rather than deleting them in a
   docs sweep.
3. **The mechanical patterns.** First the owner/date/plan parentheticals (nearly 40). Then the
   22 prototype labels, each naming its record. Then "as it always was" (8). Then "today"/"yet"
   counts (`Two modules today`, `One module today`, `five words`). A commit each: reviewable
   by diff alone.
4. **Duplicates of walkthrough pages.** `cli/preflight.py`, `cli/status.py`, `cli/release.py`,
   `release.py`, `api.py:194-197`, `cli/system.py:89-91` and the `api.py` store banner shrink
   to a sentence and a pointer.
5. **The named format.** `saved.py`, `part_edits.py` and `texts.py`: name the `.variant.json`
   format once and use the name instead of "before the text was the truth" (15 places).
6. **The one-page history.** `menu.py`, `census.py`, the `api.py` redirects, together with the
   docs/viewer.md address rule. This needs the "one page, one viewer" retrospective drafted
   first, so nothing is lost.
7. **The datum story.** `datum_core.py`, `datum_cap.py`, `datum_core_site.py`, `readiness.py`,
   `datum_bench.py`, after its retrospective.
8. **`gathering/`, last.** It is the largest rewrite (43 passages). It needs
   docs/pictures.md, the validation record and the "gathering pictures" retrospective first,
   and its voice is deliberate, so the owner should see one module (`resolve.py`) rewritten
   before the rest follow.


# Module sections (groups worst first; within a group, heavy, then moderate, then light, most passages first)

## Group: the server's core -- api, menu, census, stays_local, docs_site, site_store, datum_core_site, demo, jobs, spaces

### apothecary/menu.py -- heavy -- 19 passages (4 rows)

| line(s) | quote (<= 15 words) | problem | home | rewrite or note (<= 25 words) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 548, 686-688, 726-727, 1032, 1047, 1214, 1224, 1229-1230, 1234, 1244 (x10) | "(the owner's answer of 2026-10-12)" / "(loop 1, docs/plans/ui-flows-2026-10-08.md)" | history (owner chose, dates, plan citations) | inline | Drop each parenthetical. The decision is the code and the sentence around it. Plans that are finished retire to History. |

Each comment then says where the option sits, e.g. "Open is the board's Machine; Control at 7." |
| 654-655 | "the task log -- what the firmware page was -- a tab of the rail's strip" | history | inline | Drop "what the firmware page was". |
| 1081, 1478-1480 (x2) | "until gathering leaves core" / "is not on any ring yet -- when it arrives" | history (plan in code) | inline | "and Gather, the gathering's report." / "The commit that follows a drag is not on a ring." Put plans in a plan or todo.md. |

Kept: 10 (rad's nine-cells record, a reference); 677-678, 731, 1270, 1276, 1283 ("appended, so no cell before it moves"): these state the address rule in the present.

## Group: pictures -- apothecary/gathering/**, apothecary/vision/**, apothecary/vocabulary/**

**Group verdict.** The gathering package (sorting many pictures) is the most narrated code in
the repository. Almost every threshold and guard is justified by the incident that produced it:
"an earlier version", "a reviewer showed", "the meter caught", "was this module's most common
mistake", plus tables of past measurements. The reasoning is often good and much of it is a
real constraint. The fix is the same each time: state the constraint in the present ("X would
do Y") and move the stories and measurement tables to a retrospective or a dated validation
record. vision/ is clean present-tense prose apart from its labels and a few owner dates.
19 modules here carry the line `PROTOTYPE — not ratified.` (3 more in G5).

| 213-216 | "the loop from a picture to a print (docs/plans/ui-flows-2026-10-08.md)" | history (plan citation) | inline | Point at walkthrough/13, which shows the loop, or drop the citation. |

**Clean:** `routes/views.py`, `routes/cameras.py`, `routes/jobs.py`, `routes/__init__.py`,
`slicer/api.py`, `slicer/service.py`, `slicer/models.py`, `example_parts_library.py` (apart
from its label), `shims/**`, `models/**`, and the root modules `__init__`, `__main__`,
`booleans`, `core`, `example`, `jscad`, `meshes`, `objects`, `primitives`, `scene`, `templates`,
`transforms`, `version`, `viewer` (`viewer.py:3-6` confirms the api.py:1380 stale finding:
composite nodes fetch their STL).

## The CLI: `apothecary/cli/**` and every `--help`

Read: all 21 modules' comments, docstrings and `help=` strings, and the `--help` of all 68
commands and groups (58 shown, 10 hidden), dumped with click from the worktree's own install
(`code-prose/help.txt`). The `--help` texts are the click docstrings and `help=` strings of
`apothecary/cli/*.py`, so a row below that is visible in `--help` says so ("in --help").

Verdict: the help texts are in good shape -- present tense, imperative or descriptive, each command
saying what it does and what it needs. The narration sits in module docstrings and a few
comments, and in two `--help` texts a person reads (`preflight`, `parts verify`). Three module
docstrings repeat their walkthrough page (preflight / 09, status / 07, release / 10) with
incident stories in them. `docs generate`'s docstring is stale: it names one workflow where
two are marked `docs`. `kernel-reference`'s help sends a reader to a dated plan.

### apothecary/cli/preflight.py -- moderate -- 4 passages

| line(s) | quote (<= 15 words) | problem | home | rewrite or note (<= 25 words) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3-6 | "CI is not a barrier on this repository -- `main` is unprotected and no ruleset" | duplicate | delete (keep walkthrough/09) | Same text as walkthrough/09-preflight.md:5-7. Docstring: "`apothecary preflight`: run the CI workflows here, before a push; walkthrough/09 says why." (Checked: main unprotected, 0 rulesets via `gh api`.) |
| 50-53 (in --help) | "which is how a green local suite hid a CI failure here more than once" | history | inline + retrospective → apothecary: CI and preflight | "...a fresh runner does not, so a green run here can still fail in CI." |
| 71-73 | "Five failing workflows all saying the same thing about a shell is noise" | count, ornament | inline | "Refuse to report gates red for a reason not about them: a missing shell would fail every workflow alike." |
| 119-123 | "That difference is not cosmetic -- in the sibling project, one workflow's `uv sync --locked`" | history, duplicate | inline + retrospective → apothecary: CI and preflight | "CI gives each job a fresh machine; here one workflow's `uv sync --locked` would strip the tools a later one needs." Story is in walkthrough/09:27 too. |

### apothecary/cli/docs.py -- moderate -- 2 passages (one of them stale)

| line(s) | quote (<= 15 words) | problem | home | rewrite or note (<= 25 words) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3-9 | "**This does not produce the walkthrough.** ... It was produced here once" | history, ornament, stale | inline + retrospective → apothecary: the walkthrough and generated docs | "The walkthrough is written by the tests that assert it, not here. This writes the workflows marked `docs`: the fractal viewer and the printer monitor." Stale: "What is left here is the fractal viewer workflow" -- `tests/e2e/test_docs_printer_monitor.py:64` is also `@pytest.mark.docs`. Bold whole sentence is ornament. |
| 214-217 | "The picture walkthrough asks the server to look at a picture" | stale | inline (or delete with the env setting) | No test this command runs uses `picture_folder` (checked both `test_docs_*` marked `docs`; the photo walkthrough is not marked `docs`). Say what the folder is for now, or drop it. |

### apothecary/cli/status.py -- moderate -- 2 passages

| line(s) | quote (<= 15 words) | problem | home | rewrite or note (<= 25 words) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3-5 | "Colour and glyphs were being chosen per command, so the same outcome looked different" | history | inline | "These are the marks every command uses, so one outcome looks the same from any command, and the progress bar every long loop uses." |
| 23-24 | "Windows still defaults to cp1252 and this CLI has already died once on a check mark" | history, duplicate | inline | "The marks are ASCII: a Windows console defaults to cp1252, which cannot print a check mark." Same story at walkthrough/07-status-and-progress.md:17-18. |

### apothecary/cli/parts.py -- light -- 3 passages

| line(s) | quote (<= 15 words) | problem | home | rewrite or note (<= 25 words) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 275-278 (in --help) | "and nothing has been keeping the two honest" | history, stale | inline | "A wrapper's get_bounds is hand-written beside hand-written OpenSCAD; this measures how far they differ, which is how wrong anything consuming the envelope is." (`checklist` and this command keep them honest now.) |
| 494 | "Otherwise, use template rendering (legacy/generic)." | history | inline | "Otherwise, the template's include stub." |
| 633 (in --help) | "Note: This imports STL files, not SCAD modules, for reliable rendering" | ornament | inline | Drop "Note:": "It imports STL files, not SCAD modules, so it renders however a part defines its modules." |

### apothecary/cli/release.py -- light -- 2 passages

| line(s) | quote (<= 15 words) | problem | home | rewrite or note (<= 25 words) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5-7 | "a contributor here had no way to learn that until it was written down" | history | inline | End at "geometry reaches a consumer by publishing." walkthrough/10-being-depended-on.md holds the explanation. |
| 47-49 | "The consumer's side of this is already automated" | history (mild) | inline | "The consumer's side is automated: it reports the deviation while nothing is published and fails once something is." (A claim about datum; not checked from here.) |

### apothecary/cli/kernels.py -- light -- 1 passage

| line(s) | quote (<= 15 words) | problem | home | rewrite or note (<= 25 words) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 31-33 (in --help) | "(see docs/plans/rust-geometry-kernels-2026-10-09.md and tests/test_kernel_comparison.py)" | structural: dated plan as reference | reference → `docs/kernels.md` (new) or docs/README.md "The Rust workspace" | Point at the present-tense page; the plan retires to History when finished. |

### apothecary/cli/server.py -- light -- 1 passage

| line(s) | quote (<= 15 words) | problem | home | rewrite or note (<= 25 words) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 97-98 | "The JSCAD viewer these named is served by no route; the flags do nothing" | history | inline | "`--viewer-path` and `--no-viewer` are accepted and ignored, hidden, until the next release, so scripts passing them keep working." |

### apothecary/cli/photo.py -- light -- 1 passage

| line(s) | quote (<= 15 words) | problem | home | rewrite or note (<= 25 words) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 536-538 | "Writing over somebody's notes because they used two different file names is not a thing to do once." | ornament | inline | Keep the first sentence; drop the last. |

### apothecary/cli/openscad.py -- light -- 1 passage

| line(s) | quote (<= 15 words) | problem | home | rewrite or note (<= 25 words) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 84 (in --help) | "Windows on ARM not supported yet" | history (mild: "yet") | inline | "Windows on ARM  not supported". |

**Clean:** `cli/__init__.py`, `census.py`, `firmware.py`, `inventory.py`, `main.py`, `render.py`,
`retired.py`, `slicer.py`, `spaces.py`, `system.py`, `testing.py`. Checked: `system.py:89-91`'s
"static 'Layout valid' chip" is still true (`templates/fractal_viewer.html.j2:702`).

**Kept, with reasons:** the 10 hidden retired commands (`dev`, `install`, `inventory`,
`photo look`, `submodules`, `system`, `test run-e2e`, `test setup-e2e`, `test validate-e2e`,
`testrun`) say "Retired: use X". A retired command exists to say that, so the text is a present
fact. `retired.py` and `photo.py:108` keep them "for one release", and no release has been cut
since 0.1.0 (CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]`), so that is still true. Deleting the stubs at the next
release removes the passages. `photo gather`'s "You are better at this than it is" (449-459, in
--help) is a claim that motivates `--answers`, not ornament.
