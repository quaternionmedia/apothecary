# Inventory: the walkthrough (`walkthrough/00`–`16`)

Read at `wt-timeless` (`build/timeless-docs`, c67725a). `check_timeless.py --all` finds two
lines in this area: `05-contested-numbers.md:30` ("until recently") and <!-- timeless: allow quoting a phrase the check flags, in the sweep's own inventory -->
`tests/e2e/test_docs_photo_walkthrough.py:7` ("used to be"). Everything else below was found <!-- timeless: allow quoting a phrase the check flags, in the sweep's own inventory -->
by reading the files.

## 1. Verdict

The hand-written pages 00–10 are mostly in the present tense, and their doctests hold their
facts. Seven of them (04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09 and 10) still carry internal history in plain
words: what replaced what, what a review found, how often something failed. Nearly every
time, the history is there to justify a constraint that can be stated as a present fact. A
few pages have light ornament ("the whole point", "the part that matters"). Pages 11–16 are
generated, and only page 11 carries history. They do have three §1 failures that the shared
header hides:

- **Page 14.** The "does not show" list says the words leave out which OpenSCAD measured,
  but steps 1, 3 and 11 print "(read from the STL)".
- **Page 15.** Step 1 prints `undefined: not installed`. The test reads `data-id`, but the
  slicer card carries `data-slicer`.
- **Page 16.** Steps 4 and 7 print a folder that changes from run to run
  (`/tmp/piP/w3/server2/variants.git`; the previous commit had `w2`). CI's
  `git diff --exit-code -- 'walkthrough/*.md'` (pytest.yml:122) cannot reproduce it.

The header on pages 11–16 ("Every sentence below was emitted by a test that had just
asserted it") overclaims. The intro, the runtime note, the STL sentence and the "does not
show" list are fixed strings, and that is how page 14's bullet went stale.

There are also structural problems:

- **Mixed audiences.** The numbered sequence mixes four audiences: setup (00), library
  concepts through `datum_core` (01–06, 08), contributor and maintainer process (07, 09, 10),
  and demonstrations (11–16).
- **Routing.** Page 00 sends a newcomer to 13–16 first and then "01 onward". It never
  mentions 11 or 12, and its summary of 01 onward leaves out 07, 09, 10, 11 and 12.
- **Missing reference pages.** Pages 09 (preflight) and 10 (releases) are contributor policy
  with no reference page in `docs/`.
- **Duplication.** Pages 05, 06 and 08 present the one `board_y` dispute three times. Pages
  04 and 05 both doctest the one-page redirect. Pages 02 and 05 restate the part editor,
  which page 14 and `docs/viewer.md` already describe.
- **Inconsistencies.** Page 00 serves on port 8000, while 02–04 use 8765. Page 02 sends the
  reader to page 04 to select a part, but page 14 covers that.

## 2. Tables

Problem kinds: history / ornament / stale / duplicate / count. A row marked **ok** is a
passage of a generated page that needs no edit; it is listed for its source line. On the
hand-written pages, lines without a row are clean.

### 00-getting-started.md

| line(s) | quote | problem | home | rewrite or note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 88–93 | "one rail beside it holds Site … and Selected, over a strip of tabs" | duplicate | reference → `docs/viewer.md` (its rail section, :161–178) | Keep one sentence: the page opens on the garage, and [the viewer] describes its controls. |

## 3. Retrospectives this area needs (qm `perspectives/`, one dated file each)

1. **apothecary: the datum parts**
   - `parts/datum`, a single-piece tray, was replaced by the compound `datum_core` + `datum_cap`.
   - `datum_core` was left with six orphan parameters when the cover moved to `datum_cap`.
   - The `walls`/`tolerence` dispute (2.4/0.2, citing a record that lacked them) was retired
     along with its only source.
   - The black-box seam moved from `parts/datum` to `datum_core`.
   - The obligation to publish was written only in datum's repository until page 10.
2. **apothecary: build readiness and the problems index**
   - The checklist read `build()` as one object and reported "no stubs remain".
   - It then reported datum's stubs for every part, `calibration_cube` included.
   - An adversarial pass showed that the contested branch typed its owner instead of reading
     `KIND_OWNER`.
3. **apothecary: the viewer**
   - three.js came from a CDN. Offline, the canvas, tree and SCAD were empty while
     "Layout valid" still showed.
   - Site's SCAD waited for a drag.
   - The firmware page and the printer monitor were folded into the one page as redirects.
   - The "dashboard" name was still used for the controls.
4. **apothecary: preflight and CI**
   - In the sibling project, one workflow's `uv sync --locked` stripped another's tools, and
     the licensing gate failed for it.
   - An `npm ci` postinstall that a local cache hid.
   - Seven tests read STLs that existed only locally.
   - The CLI crashed on a check mark under cp1252.
   - The pinned runner's bare `bash` hit the WSL alias; the pin was last propagated
     2026-08-11.
5. **apothecary: the walkthrough**
   - The photo path had two demonstrations, and the page produced by `docs generate` went
     stale. They were joined into page 11.
   - Every run rewrote the tracked screenshots until pictures were compared by pixel.
   - The loop pages 13–16 moved to the browser suite only.

## 4. Reference pages to create or extend

- **`docs/viewer.md`** (extend): staging, Apply, Defaults and the variant mark in the part
  editor (from 02:79–86 and 05:57–61); three.js is vendored, so the page works offline
  (04:25–39); the census of controls (11, step 17).
- **`docs/fitting-a-part.md`** (extend): a candidate's source must be readable (05:39–43);
  how to record candidates (05:86–90); reconcile the owners with 08:34–38.
- **`docs/parts-authoring.md`** (extend): every top-level number has a parameter
  (02:37–53); the readiness checklist and its three states (06).
- **New `docs/cli.md`**, or a section of `CONTRIBUTING.md`: status marks, ASCII marks and
  cp1252, Click only (07).
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**, or a new `docs/preflight.md`: preflight (09). It covers one
  invocation per workflow, the scratch environment, `LOCAL_DIFFERENCES`, what a pass does not
  prove, and the Windows `bash` constraint.
- **New `docs/releasing.md`**: consumers (`consumers_waiting`), `apothecary release --check`,
  clause 5 and the two acts (10).
- **`tests/e2e/README.md`** (extend): how a walkthrough page is written. That covers which
  text is asserted and which is fixed, `browser_suite_only`, what is blanked or left out, and
  the CI diff check. The page header can then be one line.

## 5. Suggested order for the sweep

1. **Page 00** (the most read): lines 97–99, 156–162 and the trim at 88–93. Doctested; no
   browser run needed.
2. **The three §1 defects in the generated pages.** Each is a line or two in a test:
   test_part_loop.py:287 or :733–735; test_the_firmware_loop.py:224–227;
   test_scad_loop.py:457, :512 and :349. Regenerate with the three modules. This also makes
   CI's walkthrough diff reproducible.
3. **Ports and pointers:** 02:113, 02:118, 03:68–70, 04:55; 01:28–29, 01:46–48; 05:88–90
   ("dashboard").
4. **History in 04, 05, 06 and 08,** with the retrospectives "the datum parts", "build
   readiness…" and "the viewer" drafted alongside. Page 05's doctest is rewritten around
   `board_y`.
5. **Pages 07, 09 and 10:** move the explanation into the new reference pages, leaving short
   pages or none (see §6). Write the retrospective "preflight and CI" here.
6. **The generated header and the page 11 text**, in one commit: doc_capture.py:344–357,
   parts_built.py:101–105, page 11's intro, runtime and steps 12 and 17, its docstring, and
   00:112. Then regenerate 11–16.
7. **Restructure last** (§6). It renames screenshots, because the ordinal is in each file name
   (doc_capture.py:314). It also touches 00's `1[3-6]` glob, `docs/README.md`, and the
   "walkthrough 13/14/16" strings in the tests.

## 6. Structure: the walkthrough as a whole

- **Purpose per page.** These pages have a clear purpose: 00 (setup), 01–04 (a part, its
  numbers, an assembly, the API), 06 (readiness), 11–12 (demonstrations) and 13–16 (loops).
  Page 05's purpose is now thin: once the history is gone it is one dispute and a recipe.
  Pages 07, 09 and 10 serve a contributor or maintainer, not a newcomer.
- **Repetition.**
  - The `board_y` dispute appears on 05, 06 (L63–71) and 08 (the "contested" kind). Merge
    them into one page, "What stands between a part and a print": contested numbers, then
    readiness, then the problems index.
  - The one-page redirect is doctested on both 04 and 05.
  - The part editor is described on 02 and 05, and also on 14 and in `docs/viewer.md`.
  - Sidecar parts appear on 01 and 12 (step 3), which is fine as a demonstration; link them.
  - On page 12 (lines 12 and 127), the STL sentence and the last bullet say the same thing.
- **Order for a newcomer.** Page 00 already routes a newcomer to the loops first. The numbers
  put the loops last and contributor policy in the middle. A clearer sequence would be:
  - 00, setup;
  - the four loops (now 14, 16, 13, 15);
  - the demonstrations (11, 12);
  - the library concepts (01, 02, 03, the merged 05/06/08, 04);
  - with 07, 09 and 10 moved to `CONTRIBUTING.md` or `docs/`, their doctests kept wherever
    they land.

  Until the pages are renumbered, page 00:156–162 should at least name every page.
- **Cross-area notes.**
  - Area 1, `docs/README.md`: the walkthrough is "run by `pytest walkthrough`" (true only of
    00–10), and page 16 is described as rendering "after a second of quiet" (the code says
    300 ms).
  - Area 3: the "dashboard" comments at `datum_core.py:176` and `base.py:27`.
