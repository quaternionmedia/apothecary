# Cameras as parts, easier pictures, less on the screen

*Decided with the owner on 2026-10-04, after a survey of a busy bench: a
camera pinned at the workbench, a picture taken, its shapes found, sized and
made; printer_1 pinned to a board; the Machine and Pictures open; at 1280 and
1024 px wide. It follows the consolidation
([consolidation-2026-10-03.md](consolidation-2026-10-03.md)) and changes the
pictures plan ([pictures-in-the-world-2026-09-26.md](pictures-in-the-world-2026-09-26.md))
where they meet: a camera is no longer pinned at a structure. `uv run
apothecary census` counts the page; the records below are drafted on the
governance branch and ratified by a person.*

## What the survey found

- A camera is not a thing in the world. It is a text badge and a wire
  pyramid over the structure it is pinned at: it cannot be selected, moved,
  aimed or found in Contents, and its badge prints the device's raw label (in
  the suites, a file path).
- Badges land on each other. A place badge and a machine badge both stand
  30 px above their structure's middle, so a camera at the workbench and
  printer_1's board badge print over each other at the site's top level --
  the board badge sits there before any camera is pinned.
- The Machine opens floating over the middle of the world, about 500 by 480,
  over the scene and the hint bar; a printer's Machine shows Flashing (sketch,
  board, Compile & upload) though Flash is disabled on printers.
- The header wraps to two rows once the breadcrumb grows; the toolbar's
  violations count repeats Site's problem list, which pushes Contents out of
  the panel; the hint bar never leaves.
- From nothing to pieces is five rings opened afresh: Pin here, Take picture,
  Find shapes, Size (then a width typed in Selected), Make all. Pictures lists
  file names.

## The end state

### A camera is a part

- A camera is a root structure of the site, as a printer is: `camera_1`,
  `camera_2`..., drawn as the library's bare webcam (a body and a lens, about
  90 x 30 x 30 mm) standing in the air where it is put. It is in Contents,
  moved with the handles, and checked for overlaps like any part; in the air
  it overlaps nothing.
- It is added two ways: the ring's **Camera › Add here** on a structure or
  the floor stands one above that place's middle, looking straight down, at a
  starting height; or a camera model is dropped from the library like any
  part.
- Which of this browser's cameras it is (its device) is chosen on its own
  ring -- today's Pin here list, Allow until the browser has been asked -- as a
  serial board is pinned to printer_1. A device is one origin's, as now.
- It can be **tilted and turned**. A selected camera wears the move arrows
  and a turn ring and tilt arc, as one compact set (see *Less on the screen*).
- **The lens.** A camera starts at a typical webcam's field of view, about
  60° across. The first width typed for one of its pictures -- the picture's
  width, or one shape's long side, in Selected (Size) -- teaches the camera
  its real field of view, which it keeps. From then on each picture is sized
  by the camera's pose; Size corrects.
- **Where a picture lands.** On the first upward-facing surface -- a
  structure's top, or the floor -- that the centre of the camera's view hits;
  that surface is the picture's place, as the bench or the floor is today.
  Pointed at a wall or the sky, the picture is kept with no place: drawn on
  the camera, and nothing is made from it until the camera is aimed down.
- A view keeps the pose and field of view its camera had when it was taken:
  moving a camera does not move pictures already taken. A picture maps onto
  its surface through a pinhole projection -- one mapping, from a point in the
  picture to a point on the surface, which the mat, the outlines, Make, Why
  this and re-sizing all use. A view with no camera (a dropped file, the
  floor's Add, every view taken before this) is the same mapping with no
  perspective.
- **Reset** keeps a camera a person added and stands it back where it was
  added, looking straight down, as it stands every other part back where
  the site's definition puts it; its device and learned lens stay, and so do
  the views taken from it. Only Remove takes a camera away.
- **Cameras pinned before this start fresh.** The cameras file is no longer
  read and is left where it is; views already taken keep their place and
  width.

### Taking pictures

- Selecting a camera shows, in Selected, its live preview, **Take picture**
  (a button with its own ring cell), and its recent pictures as thumbnails; a
  thumbnail's click draws that picture where it landed.
- With a camera selected, **P** takes a picture.
- Pictures lists every picture as thumbnails grouped by camera (pictures from
  no camera -- added files -- in a group of their own), not by file name.
- Taking and finding stay two steps, as decided on 2026-10-03.

### Less on the screen

- **Badges.** A thing wears at most one small icon badge, at its own spot --
  ⚡ a board, 📷 a camera, ▣ a picture's place -- never at a shared
  structure's middle. Its words (port, sketch, shape count) show on hover or
  selection. Badges that would overlap on screen step aside or merge into a
  count (×3) until zoomed in. Hover cards never overlap each other and keep
  room between themselves and the page's edges.
- **Handles.** Whenever a movable thing is selected, one compact set: the
  move arrows, and on a camera the turn ring and tilt arc.
- **Machine.** Open shows a board's Machine in the rail's tab strip, beside
  Pictures and Bench; it floats only when floated. Sections that do nothing
  for the board fold away: a printer's Machine has no Flashing.
- **One header row.** Choosing a site loads it (Load goes). The breadcrumb
  replaces Zoom Out (a crumb goes up; Backspace still does). Snap to grid,
  Detail and Assembly outlines move into one ⚙ **View** menu, ring-backed.
  The pill reads "prototype", the full text its tooltip. Nothing wraps at
  1024 px.
- **Problems once.** Site shows one folded line, "N problems ›"; the header's
  count opens it.
- **The hint bar** shows on a first visit and fades after a few actions; `?`
  brings it back.
- **Walls** are drawn faded, and a click in the world passes through them to
  what is behind or inside. A wall's row in Contents still selects it (drawn
  solid then, with its handles); ⚙ View › **Walls selectable** turns clicking
  them back on for the session. Walls are the parts of the wall category.

## Stubs for later

Asked for on 2026-10-04: the library's other camera models are present as
stubs -- a webcam on a desk stand, on a clamp arm, and on a ceiling mount. Each
is a part folder tagged `stub`, its description saying what it will be, and
draws only the webcam for now. Add here never uses a stub.

Offered on 2026-10-04 and not chosen, kept here for a later round:

- A picture landing on any face, walls and machines' sides included, with
  pieces standing out from it -- needs every part to have an orientation.
- A camera that only turns about its vertical axis, or only looks straight
  down.
- Learning nothing: a width typed per picture, the pose only placing it.
- The ring reopening at each next step (Take picture → Find shapes → Make
  all); Take picture finding too.
- Handles only in a Move mode, or only on hover.
- Badges keeping their words and moved apart with leaders; or only the
  selected thing's badge.
- A compact Machine card beside its machine in the world.
- Walls picked with Alt-click.
- Cameras pinned before this becoming camera parts above their structures.

## Phases

Each phase ships with the browser suite green and the census run.

1. **Camera parts.** The camera's record and part; Add here; its pose;
   the projection and the place a picture lands; the learned field of view;
   views keeping their camera's pose; Make, Why this and re-sizing through
   the one mapping; the webcam and the three stubs in the library; the
   cameras file retired.
2. **Less on the screen.** The header in one row and the View menu; problems
   once; the hint bar; the pill; badges as icons with room around them; the
   Machine in the rail and a printer's without Flashing; faded walls passed
   through; the compact handles.
3. **Cameras in the world.** The camera drawn, selected and moved; its ring
   (device, Live or Still, Take picture, Remove); turn and tilt handles;
   Selected's camera (preview, Take picture, thumbnails); P; the mat,
   outlines and frustum drawn through the projection; Pictures as thumbnails
   by camera.
4. **Pictures of it.** The walkthrough and the generated docs regenerated;
   the census run; the records' numbers filled in for ratification.

## Records this touches

Drafted on the project's governance branch, ratified by a person:

- *One screen*: the header's controls, the View menu, and the census's
  numbers.
- *rad host integration*: a camera's ring and the View menu's cells.
- *Personal data stays on the device*: where a camera's device id and label
  are kept now that the cameras file is retired.
