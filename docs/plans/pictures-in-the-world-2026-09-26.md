# Pictures in the world: a look is pinned where it was seen

*Nothing in this page is built. It works inside the frame of
[one-screen-2026-09-20.md](one-screen-2026-09-20.md) (anchors, popups,
panels; the world is never replaced; every action has a cell; the census is
the meter) and under the draft record* Personal data stays on the device
*(§6: the picture root, `captures/` and `uploads/`, and what a page may
forget).*

*Renamed by the consolidation plan's Phase 1
([consolidation-2026-10-03.md](consolidation-2026-10-03.md), Words): a look is
a **view** (`/sites/{s}/views`, `apothecary/vision/views.py`, Picture › Views);
Camera › Look is Camera › Take picture, which pins a view and finds nothing;
Picture › Find shapes finds, as a step of its own; Camera › Keep is gone. This
page keeps the words it was decided in.*

## The end state

A picture is not a record in a panel. When a picture is taken or dropped at
a place, it becomes a **look**: that picture, pinned at one root structure
of the site on screen, or at the site's floor. It is drawn there as a mat
lying on the host's top. The shapes a finder saw are outlines on the mat. A
shape becomes a piece with one ring cell, and the piece stands where the
shape was seen, in the same site, checked against the world for overlap. A
camera is a badge at the structure it is pinned to, and its frustum looks
down onto the mat. While it is live, the mat shows its video. No picture
ever builds a site of its own, and nothing ever switches the site on screen
as a side effect.

What stands in front of the world, and nothing else:

- **The place badge** (an anchor): one per host that has a camera or a look,
  the floor included. It is read, not operated. A click selects the host, as
  a machine badge does.
- **Selected** (a panel, docked until Phase 6 tethers it to the
  selection): the facts of whatever is picked -- a host's camera and looks,
  a chosen shape, a piece's provenance -- the boxes a ring cannot type (a
  width in millimetres; a part's or made piece's parameters) and, for those,
  the part editor's sections. It carries no verb buttons: verbs are the
  ring's.
- **Kept** (a panel, closed to its tab): the one list §6 asks for. Every
  picture under the root (the folder's own, `captures/`, `uploads/`; ✕ on
  kept ones only), and everything this page pinned on every site (cameras,
  boards, looks), each taken back from its row.

The Camera & pictures panel is gone. So are the preview in the rail, the
name box, the placement note, the second list of cameras, the three refresh
buttons, the gather half (to the `[photos]` extra), the site switch after
Look, the arrangement sites in the site picker, the album and picture routes
no page links to, and `apothecary photo view`.

## What each thing is, and how they link

**Host.** A root structure of the site whose `world_bounds()` is not `None`
and that is not a made piece (a piece with provenance in `vision/looks.py`),
or the site itself (*the floor*). Only these hold cameras and looks; any
other structure is refused with its reason (in garage, `garage_building`
has no footprint; a made piece is refused because its pins would go stale
when it is dropped or reset). A root structure's `world_bounds()` is
already in the site's frame (`apothecary/hierarchy.py:126-137`), so its
world top-centre needs no walk up the tree; the gizmo edits only root
structures at the top level (`isEditableSelection`,
`templates/fractal_viewer.html.j2:1893`), and `check_no_overlaps` compares
only siblings (`hierarchy.py:271-296`). A look's *anchor* is the point its
mat is laid from. At a host it is the host's current top-centre, so the mat
follows the host when the gizmo moves it; pieces already made there are
siblings and stay where they were. At the floor it is fixed when the look
is pinned and stored in the look: z = 0, y at the centre of the union of
the `world_bounds()` of the roots the site's code builds (made pieces
excluded), and x at that union's +x edge plus a stated margin, or the
origin when there are no roots; it is the mat's near (−x) edge, so the mat
grows away from the site when rescaled. At the union's centre the mat would
lie inside `tray` in datum_core and inside `gridfinity` in parts_library.
Neither made pieces nor gizmo moves shift it. `vision/looks.py` computes
it. The floor is a selection but not a node: its
key is `@floor` in the page, and `host: ""` in every look and camera route.
It is selected by the canvas ring's Pictures › Floor, which works on an
empty site, or by a click on its badge, on its mat outside the outlines, or
on one of its outlines at the top level. Selected then shows its camera,
looks and width box.

**Where a picture lands.** A drop, paste or Add on any node pins at that
node's root ancestor, and on a made piece at the host its provenance
records; on empty canvas, at the floor. When the view is zoomed in
(`focusPath` not empty), the page first steps out to the top level, as ◀ out
does -- a view change, never a site switch -- so the new mat is seen.
Several files dropped at once are each kept and pinned as their own look;
the finds run one after another, the last is drawn, and the status names the
count and every file refused.

**Picture.** A file under the picture root, as today: the folder's own,
`captures/`, `uploads/`. Its one name is its path relative to the root, and
`GET /photos/pictures/file?path=` is its one route, gaining `&px=` for mats
and Kept cards: clamped to a few sizes, JPEGs decoded with `Image.draft`,
magic-byte checked as now, answered with `Cache-Control: no-store` so no
picture enters the browser's disk cache. Reuse is in memory: one texture
per drawn look and one object URL per Kept card for the page's lifetime. A
picture carries no links itself; looks point at it.

**Camera.** Two halves, as today: the browser's device (deviceId and label,
per origin) and its pin in `cameras.json` (`apothecary/routes/pictures.py`),
which gains `mm_across`: the default copied into each new look from it. A
host holds at most one camera: Pin here at an occupied host replaces that
pin and says so, and pinning a camera at another host moves it, as `PUT`
does today (`cameras.json` accepts several at one path,
`routes/pictures.py:489-512`, so `PUT` gains the replace). A pin is a
per-origin deviceId: when the host's camera is not among this browser's
cameras, its ring shows the pin's label with Unpin and Pin here only, and no
Live, Look or Keep. The UI says *pin* and *unpin* for cameras, boards and
pictures alike; the `/cameras` route names stay until one-screen Phase 5.
The live stream exists only while Live is on at its host, and stops when the
host is deselected, leaves the level in view, or a Look is taken: Look ends
Live, and the mat shows the new look with its outlines (Live is one cell
away). Look from Still opens the pinned device, waits for `loadeddata` and
500 ms more, keeps the frame, and stops the stream again. Captures are
`<stamp>-<camera id>.png`: the id already matches `CAMERA_ID`; the browser's
label stays in the pin only.

**Look** (new; replaces the shelf's `Built` as what the browser sees):
`{id: look_<UTC stamp>, site, host, picture, camera | null, taken_at,
finder, scale: {mm_across} | {shape index, mm} | null, pixel size, shapes,
made: {shape index → piece path}}`. A host may hold several looks; one is
*drawn* (the newest, until a person picks another), and every Picture verb
acts on the drawn one. Picking a look to draw -- by Looks, by Why this or
Shape on a piece made from another look -- is a view change, not a site
switch. A look never changes its finder or its shapes: Find with another
finder makes a new look of the same picture at the same host, which becomes
the drawn one, and the old keeps its shapes and made map. A look is *data
attached to a host*, not a node in the tree: `GET /sites/{name}` does not
change, so SCAD, STL, validation and jobs never see one. The page fetches a
site's cameras and looks in one request, `GET /sites/{s}/attached`, at
`loadSite`. The store is `apothecary/vision/looks.py`, in memory (as the
shelf is today) behind its own `threading.Lock`, held only for dictionary
reads and writes, never across `finder.look()` or file I/O. Its shapes come
from `apothecary/vision/cache.py`, which Phase 2 builds (none exists today):
in memory, behind its own lock, keyed as the photo-finders plan keys it
(picture hash, backend, model digest, prompt version), until the "this
machine" decision (todo.md) lets it reach the disk. A look keeps at most a
stated number of shapes, by confidence, and says how many it left out; that
is the outline budget per mat.

**Scale.** A look's scale is the only width drawn and used, and Selected's
width box follows the selection, never a mode. With a host or the floor
selected it reads *picture width, mm* and sets `{mm_across}` on the drawn
look (the camera's default when the host has no look). With a shape chosen
it reads *this shape's long side, mm*, prefilled from the current scale,
and sets `{known_index, mm}`. On a made piece there is no look-scale box:
the scale is read-only provenance text, and the one width is the part
editor's parameter. Size focuses the box. `PUT /sites/{s}/looks/{id}/scale`
always stores the derived `mm_across` (mm ÷ the shape's long side as a
fraction of the picture's width) on the look's camera, so a camera at a
fixed height is sized once; Selected's camera row says *from the last width
typed*, and a later look can still be rescaled alone. `ScaleReference`
gains `known_index`, since labels may repeat
(`apothecary/vision/models.py:151-157`). Rescaling a look moves its unmade
outlines only; made pieces keep the scale in their provenance.

**Found shape.** `vision/models.FoundShape`, no longer thrown away after
`finder.look()`: box, points, confidence, origin, label, turn, sides, and the
word and reason `word_for` gave. Identity: (look id, index). Drawn as an
outline on the drawn look's mat, with an invisible pick mesh, except while
Live (outlines of a past frame are hidden over the present one) and except
when it is made (its piece is picked instead). An outline whose centre falls
inside the extent recorded, when it was made, for a piece made at the same
host from any look (its centre and size in mm from its host's top-centre,
or in the site's frame at the floor, kept in its provenance) is drawn as
*already made (piece)*; Make all skips it and says how many it skipped.
The record, not the live footprint, decides, so a piece moved with the
gizmo neither lets its shape be made twice nor hides an outline it now
stands over. Outline pick meshes join the node meshes in one depth-sorted
raycast, so a printer standing over an outline is still the
printer. Clicking an outline selects its host and *chooses* the shape; a
click on the mat outside the outlines, or on the host, clears the choice. A
person's word overrides the table's, recorded as stated.

**Piece.** A root structure of the same site, built by `piece_from_shape`
(the per-shape half of `vision/compose.build`, split out; the CLI's `build`
uses it). `compose.py:139-147` measures from the picture's lower-left
corner; `piece_from_shape` takes the centred frame instead: its offset from
the mat's centre is `((cx - 0.5) * W, (0.5 - cy) * H)`, where `W = factor`
and `H = tallness * factor` are the mat's extent; the mat's centre is the
anchor at a host, and the anchor plus `W / 2` in x at the floor. Being a
sibling of its host, the gizmo moves it, `POST /sites/{s}/layout` keeps it,
and it renders as its own node without re-rendering the host's composite.
Only garage's validator runs the generic overlap check
(`example_hierarchy.py:704`; `validate_parts_library` is a deliberate no-op,
`validate_datum_core` checks tray against lid), so `SiteStore.validator()`
wraps every site's validator to add the `check_no_overlaps(site.children)`
violations that name a made piece, deduplicated by structure pair (garage's
`site.validate()` already reports them). Every caller -- `_site_payload`'s
four routes, the ring's Reset and `apothecary problems` (`spaces.py:226`) --
gets them from there. Resting on its host's top a piece only touches it
(`_penetrates`). Its provenance -- picture, host, camera, shape index, **a
copy of the shape**, its extent as made, word (stated or not), reason,
finder, confidence, scale -- is keyed by (site, piece path) and lives in
`vision/looks.py` behind its lock, never in the site store, so a plain-`def`
forget can mark it. The copy lets it find its outline after the look is
unpinned or the picture forgotten. An unsized shape is never made into a
piece: the outline is drawn, and the piece waits for a person's number.

**The part editor.** The browser-editing spike's decision
([part-editing-in-the-browser-2026-09-27.md](part-editing-in-the-browser-2026-09-27.md),
*Decided*) is that one editor, tethered to the part, also opens a shape
found in a picture; it is this plan's editor for a piece. This plan
proposes it opens inside Selected rather than as a second popup (see *For a
person*); until Phase 6 Selected is docked, not tethered. For a part, Part
holds the spike's Apply, Revert, Edit, Save and Variants. On a made piece,
Part holds Edit only: it opens Parameters (starting as its shape and
width), which rebuild the piece in the site store through
`piece_from_shape` and `word.make`, keeping its position and name. A made
piece has no `part_ref` and is never saved as a variant: its shape is
copied from a person's photo, and no git ref is a place §6 lists.

**Links now:** camera → its looks; look → picture, host, shapes; shape →
piece; piece → look and shape; picture → looks (the store is indexed by
picture). Never made: a site built from a picture; a piece in another site.

**Cascades.** Forgetting a kept picture unpins its looks; pieces made from
it stay, their provenance saying the picture is gone. Purge does that for
every kept picture. Unpinning a look never deletes a picture; its made
pieces stay. Unpinning a camera leaves its looks (they belong to the place).
Reset returns the site to its code: made pieces go with the other layout
edits, and their shapes read as found again: `SiteStore.reset` calls
`looks.forget_made`, so both reset paths (`api.py`'s `reset_site_layout` and
the ring's `carry_out`, `routes/menu.py:147`) clear the made map. A look
whose host is gone is listed in Kept as *gone*, as a stale pin is today.

**Browser.** `localStorage` keeps the panel layout, as today. Nothing
picture-shaped is stored in the browser, its HTTP cache included.

## Every surface today, and where it goes

| Today | Becomes | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Camera & pictures panel, `apothecary/static/widgets/camera.js` | Deleted by Phase 5; its parts go to the rows below. Stream and file calls move to `apothecary/static/pictures.js` with no markup | Five record types in one panel, none at its place |
| Live preview `<video>` in the rail | A `VideoTexture` on the mat at the camera's host; a 1×1 `<video>` in the anchor layer is its source | The camera's view drawn where it looks |
| Allow, camera pick, camera ⟳ | Camera › Pin here › *label* (an Allow leaf until the browser has asked); devices re-listed on `devicechange` | Allow opens the first device, not the pinned one |
| Name and width boxes | Name gone; width is Selected's width box (see *Scale*) | The name box names a site that is no longer made |
| Capture | Camera › Keep: the frame is kept and listed in Kept, not pinned, not found | Reference frames of the bench need no finder |
| Look | Camera › Look: keep the frame with camera and host, find, pin the look | A frame is always taken somewhere |
| Place note, Place at selected, Unplace | Camera › Pin here / Unpin on the host's ring; the badge is the note | Placing starts from the place |
| Pictures grid, ticks, all, ⟳, ✕ | Kept's grid: every picture under the root, look count per picture, ✕ on kept ones; a card click *chooses* it (named in the status bar), and dragging it onto a structure is the pointer's way to Picture › Folder › *chosen*; ticks and all go with gathering; ⟳ goes | Home for a picture at no place |
| Add pictures, Purge kept | Canvas ring Pictures › Add / Purge; drop and paste in the world | Adding lands at a place in one gesture |
| Gather report, answers, Open as one | The `[photos]` extra, CLI only, never registering a site | Decided (todo.md, Next round); Open as one replaces the world |
| Cameras in the world list | Kept's pinned rows | The same record as the badge |
| Boards pinned to pieces list | Kept's pinned rows (stale pins still shown) | Here only because of §6; Kept is that list |
| Camera badge | The place badge: camera and look at one host; a click selects it | Anchors are read, not operated |
| Camera frustum (fixed +Y) | Looks down onto its host; its base is the mat | Compose already reads a picture as a view from above |
| Selected panel | Stays, with provenance for every node that has one (`renderEditablePanel` shows none), camera and look facts with a row per look (a row click chooses that look), the width box, the part editor's sections; no verb buttons; tethered from Phase 6 | The one sheet for what is picked |
| Contents and word chips | Unchanged; made pieces are root rows | The tree already covers them |
| OpenSCAD panel | Unchanged; no longer the only visible provenance | Build output |
| `openSite` after Look / Open as one; arrangement sites in the picker | Deleted | Each picture makes a new world |
| Status bar and `#cam-note` | Status bar only, refusals in the error class | Every message is written twice, refusals as success |
| Canvas ring Camera group | Canvas ring Pictures in the same seat | Adding and purging start from empty canvas |
| Node ring | Camera and Picture groups appended on hosts, Part after them; a floor ring | Verbs on the host they are about |
| `GET /photos/{name}` (album) | Provenance in `GET /sites/{s}/attached`; the route goes in Phase 7 | No page caller |
| `GET /photos/{name}/picture` | `GET /photos/pictures/file`; goes in Phase 7 | One picture, one route |
| `POST /photos`, `GET /photos`, `DELETE /photos/{name}`, `vision/shelf.py` | Look routes; the old ones go in Phase 7 | Build, shelve and register is written four times |
| `/photos/pictures*` | Stay; `POST` gains `site`, `host`, `camera` (keep and pin in one request); forget and purge cascade | §6's file layer, now joined |
| `/cameras` | Stay; `PUT` gains `mm_across` and accepts the floor | The pin store is right |
| Board pin routes, Selected › Device | Unchanged; listed through `GET /placed` | Firmware's own |
| `photo find / build / words / finders / check` | Stay; `build` uses `piece_from_shape` | Terminal tools, not windows |
| `photo view`, `photo gather --open` | Deleted (Phase 1 for `--open`, Phase 7 for `view`): `apothecary serve`, then drop the file on a structure | Each starts a second server on the same port and can cover a built-in site |
| `photo gather`, `gather-check`, the gathering map | The `[photos]` extra | Decided |
| Walkthroughs 11 and 12 | Rewritten to drive the world, not `page.request` | Chapter 11's captions for steps 14-15 say more than its screenshots show |

## The tasks, walked in the end state

A step is one pointer act or one ring path. A window is anything in front of
the world other than a panel already open.

| Task | Steps | Windows |
|---|---|---|
| Take a frame from a camera pinned at the bench | Click its badge (the bench is selected); Camera › Look, from Live or Still. The frame is kept with its camera and host, Live ends, the finder runs, the mat shows it with outlines, sized from the camera's last width. | None (the browser's prompt the first time) |
| Keep a frame without finding | Click the badge; Camera › Keep. Listed in Kept. | None |
| Add a photo from disk | Drag the file (or several) onto a structure: kept in `uploads/`, pinned at its root, found. Onto empty canvas: pinned at the floor. Paste pins at the selected host (named `<stamp>-paste.png`). By ring: Picture › Add on the selection, or Pictures › Add for the floor, then the OS dialog. | The file manager, or the OS dialog |
| Find shapes in a picture | None after a pin: finding is part of pinning. A picture already under the root: select a host or the floor, Picture › Folder › *one of the seven newest*; any other: click its card in Kept (Folder's eighth leaf opens Kept), then Folder's eighth leaf, now *its name*, pins it. | None, or Kept |
| Photograph a loose part on paper and model it | Drop the photo on empty canvas (the floor is selected, its look drawn beside the site); click an outline; type its long side in Selected; Picture › Make piece. | None |
| Make a found shape a piece | Click the outline; Picture › Make piece. It stands on its outline, and an overlap shows red in the world and in Validation. At an unsized look, type the shape's long side in Selected first (Size focuses the box). Move it with the gizmo. | None |
| From a piece, see its picture and shape | Select it: Selected shows its provenance. Why this frames it, draws its look, lights its outline and draws a thread to it, the selection staying on the piece; with the look gone, the outline is drawn from the piece's copy. Picture › Shape draws its look, selects the host and chooses the shape. | None |
| Go back to an older look | Picture › Looks › *one of the seven newest*; any other: click its row in Selected (every look), then Looks' eighth leaf, now *its name*, draws it. | None |
| Forget pictures | One: Picture › Forget, or ✕ in Kept. Everything kept: Pictures › Purge, then one confirm naming the counts; the folder's own stay. | The confirm, for Purge |
| Pin or unpin a camera or picture | Camera: select a host, or the floor by Pictures › Floor on an empty site, then Camera › Pin here › *label*. Picture: any of the add or find paths above. Unpin from the host's group, from Kept's row, or, when the host is gone, Pictures › Stale › *row*. | None (the prompt the first time) |

## The ring

Seating is menu.py's, cardinals first by option order; absent options are
absent, not greyed; no ring holds more than eight, and no address is more
than four rings from the top. Picture lists never go through `_grouped`,
which refuses more than 64 and would 409 the whole ring (`menu.py:442-447`,
`routes/menu.py:110-113`): a list is the seven newest, and the eighth cell
acts on the one chosen in the panel that holds the rest (Kept's card,
Selected's look row), reading its name, or opens that panel when none is
chosen. So a card or row click has the address of that eighth cell.
Addresses are the resolver's to compute and the page's to write
(`annotateControls` is extended to Selected and Kept). The resolver is told
a Picture context -- `{looks here, drawn look, chosen shape, chosen picture,
chosen look, made, sized, finders, camera here, this browser's cameras, the
seven newest pictures}` -- as it is told a Device today; it never looks one
up. The page re-fetches `GET /photos/pictures` (newest first) when a ring
opens, coalesced with the ring's other context requests, and adds the
Picture context to its ring cache key
(`templates/fractal_viewer.html.j2:3957`, `:4001`), so a choose, look or
make is never answered from a stale ring.

- **Canvas ring** (nothing selected). The Camera group becomes **Pictures**
  in the same seat, so no other canvas cell moves: Add (pins at the floor),
  Floor (`select:@floor`, the floor ring, reachable with nothing pinned),
  Purge, [Stale › *row*]. Panels › Camera becomes Panels › Kept in the same
  seat. Pieces lists the code's roots as now, and made pieces under one
  grouped **Made** cell; a make refuses, with its reason, to take a site's
  made pieces past what that cell holds (`_grouped`'s 64), so the canvas
  ring cannot overflow.
- **Node ring.** Zoom in, Move, [Device], Why this, [Into], [Up], then
  **[Camera]**, **[Picture]**, **[Part]**, appended so no existing cell
  moves. Camera and Picture are offered on hosts and made pieces (Picture
  only) and Up only below the root, so the most a node holds is eight: a
  host with a board, children and a part. Part is the spike's group on a
  part, Edit alone on a made piece (*The part editor*).
  - Camera: Pin here › *this browser's cameras* (Allow until asked), Live |
    Still, Look, Keep, Unpin; Live, Look and Keep only when the pin is one
    of this browser's cameras.
  - Picture on a host: Add, Folder › (the seven newest, then *In Kept* or
    *the chosen picture*), then with a look here: [Looks › (the seven
    newest, then *In Selected* or *the chosen look*)], Make all, Size, [Find
    › *finder*] (only when more than one finder can read this picture),
    Unpin, Forget (kept pictures only, destructive). At most eight.
  - Picture with a shape chosen replaces that ring: Make piece | Its piece,
    Word › (the vocabulary's words, grouped past eight), Size, Unchoose.
  - Picture on a made piece: Word ›, Shape (draws its look, selects the host
    and chooses the shape), Drop (the piece goes; its shape stays).
  - Why this stays `explain` everywhere.
- **Floor ring** (the floor selected): Fit, Camera, Picture (the same groups,
  the chosen-shape ring included), and no Zoom, Move or Into. The floor ring
  and the chosen-shape ring are new ring shapes (*For a person*). So the
  deepest path is Picture › Word › *group* › *word*, four rings.
- **Kept rows and cards** carry no verb buttons except the take-back each
  row owes §6 (unpin, ✕); a row click selects what it names and ⌗ opens
  that ring, a card click chooses it. Their addresses are those of the ring
  equivalents, written by `annotateControls`.
- `CARRIED_BY` (menu.py): `camera:*` as now. `picture:make`,
  `picture:make-all`, `picture:drop` and `picture:word` on a made piece add,
  remove or rebuild root structures, a change to the arrangement, so they
  are **SERVER**, like `reset`: the intent route gains arms that call
  `vision/looks.py`, the same functions the look routes call, and the
  comment says so. Every other `picture:*` (choose, draw, find, pin) is
  **VIEWER**, the way `device` is. The deleted camera verbs leave it.
- One-screen Phase 4's board verbs sit under Device › Link beside
  Reconnect, Reset and Release, because the Device ring on a printer already
  holds eight (`menu.py:642-668`); the serial one is named Listen, so
  Camera › Live is the only Live.

## Phases

Each phase ships alone, and the world works between them. Every new or
moved listener is classified in `census.py` in the same change, in every
phase. Each ends with `uv run apothecary census`: the ring-backed share it
reports does not fall (one-screen rule 2), and `VIEWER_CEILING` in
`tests/test_census.py` is edited to what it measures, its docstring saying
what was measured before and after and naming any ring address that moved
(Phase 1: the gather cells; Phase 4: Camera › Allow, Unplace, Open as one,
the canvas Camera group becoming Pictures); then a CHANGELOG.md line for
what a user would notice, and any rewritten walkthrough page committed.

Phase 1 is todo.md's *Next round* move and lands when that round starts.
Phases 0 and 2-4 do not depend on it: the camera panel's gather section
stays, reporting only, after Phase 4 takes Open as one from it. Phase 5
deletes the rest of `camera.js` and so waits on Phase 1. Phases 2 and 4 wait
on the §6 confirmation under *For a person*: Phase 2 stores and forgets
what it asks about.

### Phase 0 — Stop the untruths and the doubles

- Delivers: provenance rows in Selected for every node that has one,
  including `renderEditablePanel` (`templates/fractal_viewer.html.j2:2031`),
  and no printer-status select for a piece whose status is `unsized`. One
  status write per message, refusals in the error class. A camera badge click
  selects its node and awaits the camera list before deciding whose camera it
  is (the first-click race in `openCamera`, :1212).
- Deletes: `#cam-note` and the second write
  (`apothecary/static/widgets/camera.js:78`, and
  `templates/fractal_viewer.html.j2:956`, which logs refusals as success).
- Tests: `tests/e2e/test_docs_photo_walkthrough.py` step 15 asserts the
  finder and confidence text, and steps 14-15 are captioned for what the
  screenshots show; a new e2e test clicks a camera badge on a page whose
  camera panel was never mounted. The `#cam-note` assertions
  (`tests/e2e/test_camera.py:95`, `:181`;
  `tests/e2e/test_docs_bench_walkthrough.py:402`) move to the status bar,
  refusals checked in the error class.

### Phase 1 — Gathering leaves core (next round)

- Mechanism, pending the answer under *For a person*: an extra only adds
  dependencies, and gathering has none beyond core, so the proposal is a
  distribution of its own: a uv workspace member `apothecary-photos`
  shipping `apothecary_photos/` (today's `apothecary/gathering`, the map,
  the benches), resolved through `[tool.uv.sources] apothecary-photos = {
  workspace = true }`. Core's `packages.find` excludes it and declares
  `[project.optional-dependencies] photos = ["apothecary-photos"]`; from a
  checkout it is `uv sync --extra photos`. Its router and `photo gather`
  mount only when `importlib.util.find_spec("apothecary_photos")` succeeds;
  otherwise `photo gather` names the extra. An exception to one-screen rule
  1, taken with the owner's extra decision: `POST /photos/gather` answers
  only with the extra, and never builds.
- Delivers: `POST /photos/gather` on the extra's router, answering the report
  and the questions only. `PICTURE_SUFFIXES` moves into `vision/`, so
  `routes/pictures.py` (line 48) and `cli/photo.py` (line 364) load without
  the extra. `apothecary/vision` stays in core whole, `album.py` with it:
  `whole_gathering` builds `Album` and returns `Built`
  (`gathering/combine.py:32`, `:353`, `:361`). The draft record's §1
  install-point list and §7's install-point test are edited to match:
  gathering installs the guard when the extra is present, and the
  stays-local test skips it by name when it is absent. CONTRIBUTING.md's
  `pytest.yml` row names the extra-absent job (the workspace member not
  installed) and the extra-only tests, which both existing jobs, unit and
  browser, run with it installed; `preflight` runs all three.
- Deletes: `GatherRequest.build` and `name`, the build branch of `POST
  /photos/gather` (`apothecary/routes/pictures.py:407-430`), `photo gather
  --open`; `whole_gathering` stays a function of the extra that nothing
  shelves or registers. `camera.js`'s gather section (ticks, all, Gather,
  answers) and the ring cell `camera:gather` (Open as one went in Phase 4).
  The extra ships no viewer surface.
- Tests: a job with the extra absent imports `routes.pictures`, answers
  `/cameras` and `/photos/pictures`, and finds no Gather cell
  (`tests/test_menu.py`). Under an extra-only marker, their imports renamed
  to `apothecary_photos`: `tests/test_pictures_api.py`'s gather cases minus
  build, `tests/test_gathering.py`, `tests/test_gathering_accuracy.py`,
  `tests/test_working_together.py`, the gathering half of
  `tests/e2e/test_docs_photo_walkthrough.py` (`:82-84`) and
  `tests/e2e/test_gathering_map_in_a_browser.py`.
  `test_gather_says_what_it_refused_and_what_it_set_aside`
  (`tests/e2e/test_camera.py`) goes. Walkthrough 11's gathering half is
  marked extra-only.

### Phase 2 — Looks, server only

- Delivers: `apothecary/vision/cache.py` (the finder cache) and
  `apothecary/vision/looks.py` (the store, anchors, provenance), and
  `apothecary/routes/looks.py`. Plain `def` in the threadpool, since they
  change no site: `POST /sites/{s}/looks` `{host, picture, camera?,
  finder?}` (finds and keeps the shapes), `PUT /sites/{s}/looks/{id}/scale`
  (also the camera's derived `mm_across`), `DELETE /sites/{s}/looks/{id}`.
  `async def` on the event loop, as `api.py`'s rule for routes that change a
  site says (line 619): `PUT /sites/{s}/looks/{id}/shapes/{i}` `{word}` (on
  a made shape it rebuilds the piece), `POST /sites/{s}/looks/{id}/make`
  `{shape | all}` (skipping shapes already made), and the made-piece
  routes, keyed by the piece so they work after its look is gone: `PUT
  /sites/{s}/made/{piece}` `{word | parameters}` rebuilds it in place,
  keeping position and name, and `DELETE /sites/{s}/made/{piece}` (Drop)
  removes it and marks its shape found again. `GET /sites/{s}/attached`,
  `GET /placed`. `host: ""` is the floor in every look and camera route,
  `PUT /cameras` included (which also replaces a host's other pin). A host
  that is not a root structure with bounds, or is a made piece, is refused
  with its reason. The overlap wrapper in `SiteStore.validator()`, and
  `looks.forget_made` in `SiteStore.reset`. `POST /photos/pictures` takes
  `site`, `host`, `camera` and pins the look it keeps. Forget and purge
  cascade through `looks.py` only. `piece_from_shape` split from
  `compose.build`, in the centred frame; provenance gains the shape index,
  copy and extent; `ScaleReference.known_index`. `?px=` thumbnails.
- Deletes: nothing a person sees; the old `/photos` routes stay (one-screen
  rule 1).
- Tests: new `tests/test_looks_api.py`, a stated fixture pinned at node
  `workbench` in site `garage`: boxes and points kept; making shape *i* at
  a stated width puts the piece's centre on the outline's centre, for a
  non-square picture and an off-centre shape, and on the floor; for every
  registered site, a floor mat of the fixture's width and a piece made at
  its centre penetrate no root structure; an overlap with `printer_1` is
  reported once, by the layout route after a move and by `apothecary
  problems`, and one in `datum_core`; looks and cameras at
  `storage_shelving.shelf_unit`, at `garage_building` and at a made piece
  are refused; a second camera pinned at a host replaces the first; an
  unsized make is refused with its reason; a first look sized by a shape's
  long side, then a second look from the same camera, gets the same mm per
  pixel; a second look at the same host does not remake a made shape, and
  Make all says how many it skipped; make shape *i*, move the piece 500 mm
  with `/layout`, take a second look: Make all skips it, and an outline
  under the moved piece is not marked made; moving the host moves its mat,
  not its pieces; Make all past the Made cell's room is refused; Find with
  another finder makes a second look and leaves the first's made map; a
  word on a made shape rebuilds its piece in place; Drop removes the piece
  and the shape reads as found; a make during a running find neither loses
  nor duplicates a piece, and a `GET` answers while a slow find runs; a
  forget during a make loses neither the mark nor the piece; names stay
  unique; unpinning a look leaves the file; forgetting a kept picture
  unpins its looks and leaves pieces marked forgotten; Purge leaves the
  folder's own; Reset, by its route and by the ring's intent, takes made
  pieces back, clears the made map and leaves looks; a path outside the
  root is refused. `tests/test_stays_local.py`: nothing written
  outside the root, its two folders and the state folder; `?px=` and
  `/photos/pictures/file` answer `no-store`; the new modules are among the
  ones §7 allows to open an image.

### Phase 3 — Looks drawn in the world

- Delivers first, on its own commit before the new modules land:
  `census.take` counts, besides `widgets/` (`census.py:891`), a named list
  in `census.py` of the marks modules -- `machine_marks.js`, and then
  `picture_marks.js` and `pictures.js` -- and a test fails when a listener
  in them is unclassified. `ring.js`, `panels.js` and `anchors.js` stay off
  the meter as chrome with their own tests (`tests/test_census.py`); the
  monitor's count does not change, since it imports none of the list. The
  count this adds is a new count, measured and written in the docstring on
  that commit, not a fall in the share.
- Delivers: `apothecary/static/picture_marks.js`, mounted like
  `machine_marks.js`: the mat (a texture from `?px=`, made once per look and
  disposed when it is unpinned or the site changes; sized by the look's
  scale, or fitted to the host's top for drawing only and marked unsized),
  outlines with pick meshes in the node meshes' depth-sorted raycast,
  *already made* outlines, the downward frustum, the place badge, the floor
  as a selection (`@floor`). Mats are drawn at the site's top level only.
  Choosing and clearing a shape. Selected shows camera and look facts.
  `loadSite` makes one `GET /sites/{s}/attached`; `this.cameras` is filled
  from it, and `refreshCameras` re-fetches it and redraws the badges, so the
  camera panel's Place and Unplace keep working until Phase 4.
- Deletes: `syncCameras`' frustum block, `refreshCameraMarks`,
  `openCamera` (`templates/fractal_viewer.html.j2:1158-1218`); the page's
  `GET /cameras?site=`.
- Tests: new `tests/e2e/test_picture_in_the_world.py` (a stated fixture
  pinned at `workbench` through `POST /sites/garage/looks` with
  `page.request`; Phase 4 switches it to a drop): the mat's pixels come from
  the picture; one outline per shape; clicking an outline chooses it; a
  click on `printer_1` over an outline selects `printer_1`; a click on the
  floor's mat selects the floor; the badge follows within a frame and is not
  dimmed by the mat; a camera placed from the panel shows its badge. The
  `cameraMarks` assertions in `tests/e2e/test_camera.py` and
  `tests/e2e/test_docs_bench_walkthrough.py` (`_camera_marks_visible`) are
  rewritten to `picture_marks`' own handle in this phase.

### Phase 4 — The loop's verbs on the host

- Delivers: node ring Camera, Picture and the floor ring, canvas Pictures,
  the Picture context and its cache key, `CARRIED_BY`. Live puts a
  `VideoTexture` on the mat; Look keeps, finds and pins, from Live or Still,
  and ends Live; Keep keeps. Drop (one file or several) and paste on the
  world, stepping out to the top level first. Make piece, Make all, Word,
  Size, Shape, Drop, Looks, Why this with its thread. Selected's width box
  and look rows. Until Kept lands, the camera panel's placed list gains a
  looks section from `GET /placed`, every site's, with unpin per row, so
  every page-made pin is listed from the phase that makes it (§6). Panels ›
  Camera opens what is left of the camera panel until Phase 5. New code goes
  into modules, not the template's inline script.
- Deletes: `openSite` and the page's `POST /photos`; `camera.js`'s camera,
  capture, Look and placement sections, and its gather section's Open as
  one with the ring cell `camera:open` (it calls `world.openSite`,
  `camera.js:277`); `CAMERA_VERBS` and `KEPT_VERBS`.
- Tests: `tests/test_menu.py`: Camera and Picture present on hosts and the
  floor, absent below the root and on a made piece (Picture only there); the
  floor reachable from the canvas ring with nothing pinned; a host whose
  camera is another browser's shows its label and Unpin, and no Live, Look
  or Keep; Part on a made piece holds Edit only, and no git ref is written;
  garage plus 64 made pieces still resolves the canvas ring; a root with
  more than 64 pictures and with 500, and a host with more than eight looks,
  still resolve, and a chosen picture or look fills the eighth leaf; the
  fullest context (a board, a camera, a part, several looks, a chosen shape,
  several finders) holds every ring and sub-ring at eight or fewer and no
  address deeper than four; make, make-all, drop and a made piece's word are
  SERVER, the rest VIEWER; no existing node or canvas cell moved; the shape,
  made-piece and floor rings; `tests/conformance/nine_cells.json` updated.
  New `tests/e2e/test_the_loop.py`, launched with
  `--use-file-for-fake-video-capture` on a drawn fixture (the rectangle,
  disc and triangle `test_camera.py` draws): on an empty site, Pictures ›
  Floor, pin the fake camera there and take a Look; then at `workbench`:
  badge, Look from Still and from Live (Live ends, the outlines show), the
  host ring opened before and after choosing an outline (Make piece appears
  after), type a width, Make piece, the overlap shows, the gizmo clears it,
  a second Look after the move sized from the first and not remaking it, Why
  this on the piece draws its look, a click on the piece selects the piece,
  the URL never changes; the same with the fixture dropped through
  `DataTransfer` (one file, and two: two looks, the last drawn), on a child
  while zoomed in (pinned at the root, the view stepped out), and on empty
  canvas (the floor selected, a width typed, the piece made); a look's row
  in the placed list unpins it. `tests/e2e/test_camera.py` rewritten around
  the host, its gather half (`:160-185`, which opens a `gathered_` site) cut
  with `openSite`. Walkthrough 11's browser half and 12 §9-11 regenerated.

### Phase 5 — One Kept panel (after Phase 1)

- Delivers: `apothecary/static/widgets/kept.js`, registered as `kept` in the
  camera panel's seat (Panels › Kept, `PANELS` in menu.py), docked right and
  closed to its tab: the grid (drag onto a structure) and *Pinned, every
  site's* (cameras, boards, looks; stale ones say so) from one `GET
  /placed`. A row click selects its host, switching site through the picker
  when the row is another site's.
- Deletes: the rest of `apothecary/static/widgets/camera.js` and its
  registration.
- Tests: new `tests/e2e/test_kept_panel.py`: rows for two sites; a stale row,
  made by pinning a board to a made piece and then Drop or Reset (*piece
  gone*), and its Pictures › Stale cell; unpin per row; a card dragged onto
  the selection; the eighth-newest picture pinned at `workbench` by card
  click and ring alone; Purge asks once and leaves the folder's own.
  `tests/e2e/test_ring.py` (Kept registered, closed by default);
  `tests/e2e/test_docs_bench_walkthrough.py` §12-13 on Kept, their stale pin
  made the same way instead of `POST /photos` and `DELETE /photos/pins_check`
  (`:370-381`).

### Phase 6 — Selected stands at the selection

- Delivers: Selected tethered through `panels.tether` to the selection's
  anchor (the host's top, a shape's centre, the camera's apex, the floor's
  badge), holding the part editor's sections for a part or a made piece:
  the plan's *a piece's properties*. Dragging lets it go; docking is
  remembered. `panels.update` caches panel sizes with a `ResizeObserver`
  instead of reading `offsetWidth` every frame
  (`apothecary/static/panels.js:300`).
- Deletes: Selected's docked default.
- Tests: `tests/e2e/test_viewer.py`: opens within 300 ms of a click, follows
  within a frame, dock remembered across a reload, one popup for a made
  piece; the loop test re-run.

### Phase 7 — Old doors closed, with one-screen Phase 5

- Deletes: `POST /photos`, `GET /photos`, `GET` and `DELETE /photos/{name}`,
  `GET /photos/{name}/picture` (`api.py:1149-1283`), `RESERVED_NAMES`,
  `vision/shelf.py`, `photo view` with its README line. `vision/album.py`
  keeps `Album`, `Built` and `Provenance`, which the extra's
  `whole_gathering` uses.
- Tests: `tests/test_photo_in_the_viewer.py` retired, its provenance facts
  already in `tests/test_looks_api.py`; `tests/e2e/test_docs_photo_walkthrough.py`
  (`:61`, `:263`, `:271`, `:334`, `:338`, and `:369-378`, the grouping check)
  rewritten to the look routes; a test holds that no route registers a site
  from a picture, and one imports `apothecary_photos`' combine, both run in
  the job with the extra installed.

## Decided by the owner (2026-09-27)

- **§6, for the first build:** a look is what a page placed or pinned,
  listed every site's in Kept and taken back the same way; forgetting a kept
  picture unpins its looks and leaves made pieces marked forgotten, each
  holding its shape's outline until Reset or Drop; `uploads/` also takes
  dropped and pasted pictures (pasted ones named `<stamp>-paste.png`); a pin
  may carry a person-stated width. **A made piece is a part like any other:**
  it may be saved as a git variant (the browser-editing spike's variant
  refs), so the rule below that a made piece is never written to a git ref,
  and "never saved as a variant", do not hold.
- **No new ring shapes.** The floor is reached from the canvas ring's
  Pictures group (Pictures › Floor › Fit, Camera, Picture), and a shape from
  its host's node ring (Picture › Make › <shape>, with Make all beside it;
  Word and Drop under Picture on a made piece). The rad record is not edited
  for ring shapes; paths are a level deeper where the plan had a ring of
  their own. Make, Make all and Drop are site changes carried by the server
  through the intent route, as other site changes are.

- **Kept's row buttons are the one control no ring backs.** Unpin on a pin
  and Forget on a kept picture, every site's, stay in Kept because §6 asks
  for a thing to be taken back from the list that shows it; the census lists
  them apart (`census.TAKEN_BACK`) and claims no ring for them. The ring
  record's §5 says so.

Where the text below disagrees with these, these win.

## What is decided here, and what a person decides

Decided by this plan: a picture enters the world only as a look pinned at a
root structure with bounds that is not a made piece, or at the floor; the
floor is a selection, beside the site, not a node; a host holds one camera;
no verb switches the site as a side effect; a piece made from a shape is a
root structure of the site on screen, overlap-checked in every site, and
this plan refuses to make one unsized; a look's scale is the one width used,
and the last width typed is its camera's default; one Kept panel is the §6
list; *pin* is the UI's one verb pair; new ring options are appended, never
inserted; picture lists in the ring are the seven newest and the one chosen;
looks are in memory until the record below says otherwise; the gathering
extra ships no viewer surface and registers no site; the browser offers a
finder choice only where more than one finder can read the picture; a made
piece is edited by its parameters only and never saved as a variant; an
exception to one-screen rule 1 for `POST /photos/gather` (Phase 1).

For a person, and for governance:

- *Personal data stays on the device* §6: confirm that a look is *what a
  page placed or pinned*, listed every site's and taken back the same way
  (Phase 4 waits on this); that forgetting a kept picture unpins its looks
  and leaves made pieces marked forgotten, each still holding its shape's
  outline until Reset or Drop; that `uploads/` also takes dropped and pasted
  pictures, pasted ones named `<stamp>-paste.png`; that a pin may carry a
  person-stated width (Phase 2 waits on these too); that a made piece's
  shape, copied from a person's photo, stays in the state it was made in and
  is never written to a git ref. §1 and §7: gathering's install point moves
  with the extra (Phase 1), and whether `apothecary.vocabulary` stays under
  the guard is settled with it, as the record's revision trigger asks.
- How gathering leaves core: the plan proposes that `apothecary/vision/`
  stays in core and gathering becomes a distribution of its own
  (`apothecary-photos`, a uv workspace member) that the `[photos]` extra
  installs; the owner decided an optional extra, and todo.md leaves how much
  of `vision/` goes to be settled when the round starts. Phase 1's mechanism
  waits on this.
- The spike's editor opens inside Selected, docked until Phase 6, rather
  than in a panel of its own tethered to the part (the spike's iteration 3
  and *Decided*); the spike plan is edited if a person agrees.
- *rad host integration* §5: a lasting exception for Kept's per-row unpin
  and per-card ✕, ring-backed buttons kept because §6 asks for things to be
  taken back from the list that shows them. Selected carries none.
- Whether looks and made pieces may be kept in the state folder across a
  restart, and the finder cache with them. This waits on what "this
  machine" means (todo.md).
- *One screen* §1: add "a verb never switches the site as a side effect".
  §3: name the mat, the downward frustum and the outlines as drawn in the
  world. §2: Selected tethered to the selection serves a host, the floor, a
  shape, a camera and a piece; an anchor's click may select the floor, which
  is a selection but not a node.
- *rad host integration* §6: its three shapes of ring gain two, the floor
  ring (`@floor`: Fit, Camera, Picture) and the chosen-shape ring; its
  node-ring list is edited to match: Word and get shape (Shape) sit under
  Picture on a made piece, and Why this stays apart; `picture:make`,
  `make-all`, `drop` and a made piece's word are carried by the server.
  Its Consequences' Link cell is edited to hold Probe, Identify
  and Listen beside Reconnect, Reset and Release. Its revision triggers do
  not fire: the fullest node ring is eight, with Part, and no address is
  deeper than four rings.
- The photo-finders plan's open question (the finder choice): answered here
  as Picture › Find, present only when it can do something; that plan's
  *Pends on* row points here.

## Not in this plan

Merging `cameras.json` and the firmware bindings into one store; a camera
that looks sideways (direction and field of view are not recorded; a picture
is a view from above); a look's offset on its host: a mat is centred on its
host's top, so a camera that frames the bench off-centre puts every piece
off by the same amount, and each is moved with the gizmo (a per-camera
offset, inherited like `mm_across`, is the follow-up if that proves costly);
pictures standing upright on a wall; looks below the root; a gathering face
in the browser (when the extra grows one, it pins a look at a host, never a
site); a finder chosen by a model; persistence across restart, until the
record allows it; the CLI's `photo find` and `build` reading paths outside
the picture root.
